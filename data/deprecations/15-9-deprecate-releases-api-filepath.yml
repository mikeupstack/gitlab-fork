    Support for specifying a `filepath` for a direct asset link in the [Releases API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases)
    and [Release Links API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/links.html) is deprecated in GitLab 15.9 and will be
    removed in GitLab 17.0. GitLab introduced a new field called `direct_asset_path` in GitLab 15.9 to replace `filepath`
    until it is finally removed.

    To avoid any disruptions, you should replace `filepath` with `direct_asset_path` in your calls to the following endpoints:

    - Releases API:
      - [Create a release](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/#create-a-release)
      - [Download a release asset](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/#download-a-release-asset)
    - Release Links API:
      - [Create a release link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/links.html#create-a-release-link)
      - [Update a release link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/links.html#update-a-release-link)
