    The support for registration tokens and certain configuration arguments in the command to [register](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/) a runner, `gitlab-runner register` is deprecated.
    We plan to implement a new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance
    as part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/).
    The work is planned in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7633).
    The new method will involve creating the runner in the GitLab UI and passing the
    [runner authentication token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#runner-authentication-tokens-also-called-runner-tokens)
    to the `gitlab-runner register` command.
  end_of_support_milestone: "17.0"  # (optional) Use "XX.YY" format. The milestone when support for this feature will end.
