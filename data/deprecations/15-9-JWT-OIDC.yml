    Now that we have released [ID tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html)
    with OIDC support, the old JSON web tokens are deprecated and will be removed.
    Both the `CI_JOB_JWT` and `CI_JOB_JWT_V2` tokens, exposed to jobs as predefined variables,
    will no longer be available in GitLab 16.0.

    To prepare for this change, you should:

    - Configure your pipelines to use the fully configurable and more secure
      [`id_token`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#id_tokens) keyword instead.
    - [Enable the **Limit JSON Web Token (JWT) access**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html#enable-automatic-id-token-authentication)
      setting, which prevents the old tokens from being exposed to any jobs. This setting
      will be permanently enabled for all projects in GitLab 16.0.
#
# If an End of Support period applies, the announcement should be shared with GitLab Support
# in the `#spt_managers` channel in Slack, and mention `@gitlab-com/support` in this MR.
