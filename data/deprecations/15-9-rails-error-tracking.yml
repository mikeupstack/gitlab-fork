    The [Error Tracking UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html) is deprecated in 15.9 and will be removed in 16.6 (milestone might change) once GitLab Observability UI is made available. In future versions, you should use the [GitLab Observability UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/opstrace/opstrace-ui/), which will gradually be made available on GitLab.com over the next few releases.

    During the transition to the GitLab Observability UI, we will migrate the [GitLab Observability Backend](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/opstrace/opstrace) from a per-cluster deployment model to a per-tenant deployment model. Because [Integrated Error Tracking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html#integrated-error-tracking) is in Open Beta, we will not migrate any existing user data. For more details about the migration, see the direction pages for:

    - [Observability](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/observability/data-visualization/).
    - The [Observability Backend](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/observability/data-management/).
    - [Data visualization](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/observability/data-visualization/).
