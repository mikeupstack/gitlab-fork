    As part of our effort to improve the security of your CI workflows using JWT and OIDC, the native HashiCorp integration is also being updated in GitLab 16.0. Any projects that use the [`secrets:vault`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#secretsvault) keyword to retrieve secrets from Vault will need to be [configured to use ID tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html#configure-automatic-id-token-authentication).

    To be prepared for this change, you should do the following before GitLab 16.0:

    - [Disable the use of JSON web tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html#enable-automatic-id-token-authentication) in the pipeline.
    - Ensure the bound audience is prefixed with `https://`.
    - Use the new [`id_tokens`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#id_tokens) keyword
      and configure the `aud` claim.
# If an End of Support period applies, the announcement should be shared with GitLab Support
# in the `#spt_managers` channel in Slack, and mention `@gitlab-com/support` in this MR.
#
  end_of_support_milestone:  # (optional) Use "XX.YY" format. The milestone when support for this feature will end.
