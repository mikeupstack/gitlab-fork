  issue_url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389467  # (required) Link to the deprecation issue in GitLab
  body: |  # (required) Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    Required Pipeline Configuration will be removed in the 17.0 release. This impacts self-managed users on the Ultimate license.

    We recommend replacing this with an alternative [compliance solution](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/compliance_frameworks.html#compliance-pipelines)
    that is available now. We recommend this alternative solution because it provides greater flexibility, allowing required pipelines to be assigned to specific compliance framework labels.
