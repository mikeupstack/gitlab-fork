    The [`artifacts:public` CI/CD keyword](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactspublic) was discovered to be not working properly since GitLab 15.8 and needed to be refactored. This feature is disabled on GitLab.com, and disabled by default on self-managed instances. If an administrator for an instance running GitLab 15.8 or 15.9 enabled this feature via the `non_public_artifacts` feature flag, it is likely that artifacts created with the `public:false` setting are being treated as `public:true`.

    If you have projects that use this setting, you should delete artifacts that must not be public, or [change the visibility](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/public_access.html#change-project-visibility) of affected projects to private, before updating to GitLab 15.8 or later.

    In GitLab 15.10, this feature's code was refactored. On instances with this feature enabled, new artifacts created with `public:false` are now working as expected, though still disabled by default. Avoid testing this feature with production data until it is enabled by default and made generally available.
