  body: |
    GitLab previously created project file exports in JSON format. In GitLab 12.10, NDJSON was added as the preferred format.

    To support transitions, importing JSON-formatted project file exports was still possible if you configured the
    relevant feature flags.

    From GitLab 15.11, importing a JSON-formatted project file exports is not supported.
