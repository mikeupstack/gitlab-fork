  body: |
    GitLab previously created group file exports in JSON format. In GitLab 13.10, NDJSON was added as the preferred format.

    To support transitions, importing JSON-formatted group file exports was still possible if you configured the
    relevant feature flags.

    From GitLab 15.8, importing a JSON-formatted group file exports is not supported.
