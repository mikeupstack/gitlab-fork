# File finder **(FREE)**

With file finder, you can search for a file in a repository directly from the GitLab UI.

File finder is powered by the [`fuzzaldrin-plus`](https://github.com/jeancroy/fuzz-aldrin-plus) library, which uses fuzzy search and highlights results as you type.

## Search for a file

To search for a file:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Repository > Files**.
1. In the upper right, select **Find file**.
1. In the search box, start typing the filename.
1. From the dropdown list, select the file.

To go to file finder, you can also press <kbd>t</kbd> anywhere in your project.
To go back to **Files**, press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

To narrow down your results, include `/` in your search.
