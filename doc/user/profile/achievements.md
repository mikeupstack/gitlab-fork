# Achievements (Experiment) **(FREE)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/113156) in GitLab 15.10 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `achievements`. Disabled by default.

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is not available. To make it available,
ask an administrator to [enable the feature flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `achievements`.
The feature is not ready for production use.

Achievements are a way to reward users for their activity on GitLab.
As a namespace maintainer or owner, you can create custom achievements for specific contributions, which you can award to or revoke from users based on your criteria.

As a user, you can collect achievements to highlight your contributions to different projects or groups on your profile.
An achievement consists of a name, a description, and an avatar.

## Types of achievement

Programmatically, there is only one way to create, award, revoke, or delete achievements.

Practically, you can differentiate between achievements that are awarded:

- Once and irrevocable. For example, a "First contribution merged" achievement.
- Once and revocable. For example, a "Core team member" achievement.
- Multiple times. For example, a "Contributor of the month" achievement.

## View a user's achievements

You can view a user's achievements on their profile page.

Prerequisites:

- The user profile must be public.
- You must be a member of the namespace awarding the achievement, or the namespace must be public.

To view a user's achievements:

1. Go to the user's profile page.
1. Below the user's avatar, see their achievements.
1. To view details about an achievement, hover over it.
   It displays the following information:

   - Name of the achievement
   - Description of the achievement
   - Date when the achievement was awarded to the user
   - Namespace that awarded the achievement

To retrieve a list of a user's achievements, query the [`user` GraphQL type](../../api/graphql/reference/index.md#user).

```graphql
query {
  user(username: "<username>") {
    userAchievements {
      nodes {
        achievement {
          name
          description
          avatarUrl
          namespace {
            fullPath
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Create an achievement

You can create custom achievements to award for specific contributions.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Maintainer or Owner role for the namespace.

To create an achievement, call the [`achievementsCreate` GraphQL mutation](../../api/graphql/reference/index.md#mutationachievementscreate).

```graphql
mutation achievementsCreate($file: Upload!) {
  achievementsCreate(
    input: {
      namespaceId: "gid://gitlab/Namespace/<namespace id>",
      name: "<name>",
      description: "<description>",
      avatar: $file}
  ) {
    errors
    achievement {
      id
      name
      description
      avatarUrl
    }
  }
}
```

## Update an achievement

You can change the name, description, and avatar of an achievement at any time.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Maintainer or Owner role for the namespace.

To update an achievement, call the [`achievementsUpdate` GraphQL mutation](../../api/graphql/reference/index.md#mutationachievementsupdate).

```graphql
mutation achievementsUpdate($file: Upload!) {
  achievementsUpdate(
    input: {
      achievementId: "gid://gitlab/Achievements::Achievement/<achievement id>",
      name: "<new name>",
      description: "<new description>",
      avatar: $file}
  ) {
    errors
    achievement {
      id
      name
      description
      avatarUrl
    }
  }
}
```

## Award an achievement

You can award an achievement to a user to recognize their contributions.
The user receives an email notification when they are awarded an achievement.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Maintainer or Owner role for the namespace.

To award an achievement to a user, call the [`achievementsAward` GraphQL mutation](../../api/graphql/reference/index.md#mutationachievementsaward).

```graphql
mutation {
  achievementsAward(input: {
    achievementId: "gid://gitlab/Achievements::Achievement/<achievement id>",
    userId: "gid://gitlab/User/<user id>" }) {
    userAchievement {
      id
      achievement {
        id
        name
      }
      user {
        id
        username
      }
    }
    errors
  }
}
```

## Revoke an achievement

You can revoke a user's achievement if you consider the user no longer meets the awarding criteria.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Maintainer or Owner role for the namespace.

To revoke an achievement, call the [`achievementsRevoke` GraphQL mutation](../../api/graphql/reference/index.md#mutationachievementsrevoke).

```graphql
mutation {
  achievementsRevoke(input: {
    userAchievementId: "gid://gitlab/Achievements::UserAchievement/<user achievement id>" }) {
    userAchievement {
      id
      achievement {
        id
        name
      }
      user {
        id
        username
      }
      revokedAt
    }
    errors
  }
}
```

## Delete an achievement

If you consider you no longer need an achievement, you can delete it.
This will delete all related awarded and revoked instances of the achievement.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Maintainer or Owner role for the namespace.

To delete an achievement, call the [`achievementsDelete` GraphQL mutation](../../api/graphql/reference/index.md#mutationachievementsdelete).

```graphql
mutation {
  achievementsDelete(input: {
    achievementId: "gid://gitlab/Achievements::Achievement/<achievement id>" }) {
    achievement {
      id
      name
    }
    errors
  }
}
```
