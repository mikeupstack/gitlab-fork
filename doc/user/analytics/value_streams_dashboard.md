You can leave feedback on dashboard bugs or functionality in [issue 381787](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/381787).

The Value Streams Dashboard is a customizable dashboard that enables decision-makers to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for digital transformation improvements.
This page is a work in progress, and we're updating the information as we add more features.
For more information, see the [Value Stream Management category direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/value_stream_management/).

## Initial use case

Our initial use case is focused on providing the ability to compare software delivery metrics.
This comparison can help decision-makers understand whether projects and groups are improving.

The beta version of the Value Streams Dashboard includes the following metrics:

- [DORA metrics](dora_metrics.md)
- [Value Stream Analytics (VSA) - flow metrics](../group/value_stream_analytics/index.md)

The Value Streams Dashboard allows you to:

- Aggregate data records from different APIs.
- Track software performance (DORA) and flow of value (VSA) across the organization.

## DevOps metrics comparison

The DevOps metrics comparison displays DORA4 and flow metrics for a group or project in the
month-to-date, last month, the month before, and the past 180 days.

This visualization helps you get a high-level custom view over multiple DevOps metrics and
understand whether they're improving month over month. You can compare the performance between
groups, projects, and teams at a glance. This visualization helps you identify the teams and projects
that are the largest value contributors, overperforming, or underperforming.

You can also drill down the metrics for further analysis.
When you hover over a metric, a tooltip displays an explanation of the metric and a link to the related documentation page.

## View the value streams dashboard

Prerequisite:

- To view the value streams dashboard for a group, you must have at least the Reporter role for the group.

To view the value streams dashboard:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu**, and:
   - For a project, select **Projects** and find your project.
   - For a group, select **Groups** and find your group.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Analytics > Value stream**.
1. Below the **Filter results** text box, in the **Key metrics** row, select **Value Streams Dashboard | DORA**.
1. Optional. To open the new page, append this path `/analytics/dashboards/value_streams_dashboard` to the group URL
(for example, `https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/analytics/dashboards/value_streams_dashboard`).

## Customize the dashboard panels

You can customize the Value Streams Dashboard and configure what subgroups and projects to include in the page.

A view can display maximum four subgroups or projects.

To display multiple subgroups and projects, specify their path as a URL parameter.

For example, the parameter `query=gitlab-org/gitlab-foss,gitlab-org/gitlab,gitlab-org/gitlab-design,gitlab-org/gitlab-docs` displays three separate panels, one each for the:

- `gitlab-org` group
- `gitlab-ui` project
- `gitlab-org/plan-stage` subgroup
