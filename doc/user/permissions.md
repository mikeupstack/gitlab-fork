# Permissions and roles **(FREE)**

When you add a user to a project or group, you assign them a role.
The role determines which actions they can take in GitLab.

If you add a user to both a project's group and the
project itself, the higher role is used.

GitLab [administrators](../administration/index.md) have all permissions.

## Roles

The available roles are:

- Guest (This role applies to [private and internal projects](../user/public_access.md) only.)
- Reporter
- Developer
- Maintainer
- Owner
- Minimal Access (available for the top-level group only)

A user assigned the Guest role has the least permissions,
and the Owner has the most.

By default, all users can create top-level groups and change their
usernames. A GitLab administrator can [change this behavior](../administration/user_settings.md)
for the GitLab instance.

## Project members permissions

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219299) in GitLab 14.8, personal namespace owners appear with Owner role in new projects in their namespace. Introduced [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags.md) named `personal_project_owner_with_owner_access`. Disabled by default.
> - [Generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351919) in GitLab 14.9. Feature flag `personal_project_owner_with_owner_access` [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219299).

A user's role determines what permissions they have on a project. The Owner role provides all permissions but is
available only:

- For group and project Owners. In GitLab 14.8 and earlier, the role is inherited for a group's projects.
- For Administrators.

Personal [namespace](namespace/index.md) owners:

- Are displayed as having the Maintainer role on projects in the namespace, but have the same permissions as a user with the Owner role.
- In GitLab 14.9 and later, for new projects in the namespace, are displayed as having the Owner role.

For more information about how to manage project members, see
[members of a project](project/members/index.md).

The following table lists project permissions available for each role:

<!-- Keep this table sorted: By topic first, then by minimum role, then alphabetically. -->

1. On self-managed GitLab instances, users with the Guest role are able to perform this action only on public and internal projects (not on private projects). [External users](admin_area/external_users.md) must be given explicit access even if the project is internal. Users with the Guest role on GitLab.com are only able to perform this action on public projects because internal visibility is not available.
2. Guest users can only view the [confidential issues](project/issues/confidential_issues.md) they created themselves or are assigned to.
3. Not allowed for Guest, Reporter, Developer, Maintainer, or Owner. See [protected branches](project/protected_branches.md).
4. If the [branch is protected](project/protected_branches.md), this depends on the access given to Developers and Maintainers.
5. Guest users can access GitLab [**Releases**](project/releases/index.md) for downloading assets but are not allowed to download the source code nor see [repository information like commits and release evidence](project/releases/index.md#view-a-release-and-download-assets).
6. Actions are limited only to records owned (referenced) by user.
7. When [Share Group Lock](group/access_and_permissions.md#prevent-a-project-from-being-shared-with-groups) is enabled the project can't be shared with other groups. It does not affect group with group sharing.
8. For information on eligible approvers for merge requests, see
   [Eligible approvers](project/merge_requests/approvals/rules.md#eligible-approvers).
9. Applies only to comments on [Design Management](project/issues/design_management.md) designs.
10. Users can only view events based on their individual actions.
11. Project access tokens are supported for self-managed instances on Free and above. They are also
    supported on GitLab SaaS Premium and above (excluding [trial licenses](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/)).
12. If the [tag is protected](project/protected_tags.md), this depends on the access given to Developers and Maintainers.
13. A Maintainer or Owner can't change project features visibility level if
    [project visibility](public_access.md) is set to private.
14. Attached design files are moved together with the issue even if the user doesn't have the
    Developer role.
15. Guest users can only set metadata (for example, labels, assignees, or milestones)
    when creating an issue. They cannot change the metadata on existing issues.
16. In projects that accept contributions from external members, users can create, edit, and close their own merge requests.
17. Authors and assignees can modify the title and description even if they don't have the Reporter role.
18. Authors and assignees can close and reopen issues even if they don't have the Reporter role.
19. The ability to view the Container Registry and pull images is controlled by the [Container Registry's visibility permissions](packages/container_registry/index.md#container-registry-visibility-permissions).
20. Maintainers cannot create, demote, or remove Owners, and they cannot promote users to the Owner role. They also cannot approve Owner role access requests.
21. Authors of tasks can delete them even if they don't have the Owner role, but they have to have at least the Guest role for the project.
22. You must have permission to [view the epic](group/epics/manage_epics.md#who-can-view-an-epic).
23. In GitLab 15.9 and later, users with the Guest role and an Ultimate license can view private repository content if an administrator gives those users permission. The administrator can create a [custom role](#custom-roles) through the API and assign that role to the users.

## Project features permissions

More details about the permissions for some project-level features follow.

### GitLab CI/CD permissions

[GitLab CI/CD](../ci/index.md) permissions for some roles can be modified by these settings:

- [Public pipelines](../ci/pipelines/settings.md#change-which-users-can-view-your-pipelines):
  When set to public, gives access to certain CI/CD features to *Guest* project members.
- [Pipeline visibility](../ci/pipelines/settings.md#change-pipeline-visibility-for-non-project-members-in-public-projects):
  When set to **Everyone with Access**, gives access to certain CI/CD "view" features to *non-project* members.

1. Groups can be set to allow either Owners, or Owners and users with the Maintainer role, to [create subgroups](group/subgroups/index.md#create-a-subgroup).
2. Default project creation role can be changed at:
   - The [instance level](admin_area/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.md#define-which-roles-can-create-projects).
   - The [group level](group/manage.md#specify-who-can-add-projects-to-a-group).
3. Does not apply to subgroups.
4. Developers can push commits to the default branch of a new project only if the [default branch protection](group/manage.md#change-the-default-branch-protection-of-a-group) is set to "Partially protected" or "Not protected".
5. In addition, if your group is public or internal, all users who can see the group can also see group wiki pages.
6. Users can only view events based on their individual actions.
7. You must have permission to [view the epic](group/epics/manage_epics.md#who-can-view-an-epic) and edit the issue.
8. You must have permission to [view](group/epics/manage_epics.md#who-can-view-an-epic) the parent and child epics.

### Subgroup permissions

When you add a member to a subgroup, they inherit the membership and
permission level from the parent groups. This model allows access to
nested groups if you have membership in one of its parents.

For more information, see
[subgroup memberships](group/subgroups/index.md#subgroup-membership).

## Users with Minimal Access **(PREMIUM)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40942) in GitLab 13.4.
> - Support for inviting users with Minimal Access role [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/106438) in GitLab 15.9.

Users with the Minimal Access role do not:

- Count as licensed seats on self-managed Ultimate subscriptions or any GitLab.com subscriptions.
- Automatically have access to projects and subgroups in that root group.

Owners must explicitly add these users to the specific subgroups and
projects.

You can use the Minimal Access role to give the same member more than one role in a group:

1. Add the member to the root group with a Minimal Access role.
1. Invite the member as a direct member with a specific role in any subgroup or project in that group.

Because of an [outstanding issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267996), when a user with the Minimal Access role:

- Signs in with standard web authentication, they receive a `404` error when accessing the parent group.
- Signs in with Group SSO, they receive a `404` error immediately because they are redirected to the parent group page.

To work around the issue, give these users the Guest role or higher to any project or subgroup within the parent group.

## Custom roles **(ULTIMATE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/106256) in GitLab 15.7 [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags.md) named `customizable_roles`.
> - [Enabled by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/110810) in GitLab 15.9.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/114524) in GitLab 15.10.

Custom roles allow group members who are assigned the Owner role to create roles
specific to the needs of their organization.

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i>
For a demo of the custom roles feature, see [[Demo] Ultimate Guest can view code on private repositories via custom role](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46cp_-Rtxps).

### Create a custom role

To enable custom roles for your group, a group member with the Owner role:

1. Makes sure that there is at least one private project in this group or one of
   its subgroups, so that you can see the effect of giving a Guest a custom role.
1. Creates a personal access token with the API scope.
1. Uses [the API](../api/member_roles.md#add-a-member-role-to-a-group) to create the Guest+1 role for the root group.

### Associate a custom role with an existing group member

To associate a custom role with an existing group member, a group member with
the Owner role:

1. Invites a user to the root group or any subgroup or project in the root
   group's hierarchy as a Guest. At this point, this Guest user cannot see any
   code on the projects in the group or subgroup.
1. Optional. If the Owner does not know the `ID` of the Guest user receiving a custom
   role, finds that `ID` by making an [API request](../api/member_roles.md#list-all-member-roles-of-a-group).

1. Associates the member with the Guest+1 role using the [Group and Project Members API endpoint](../api/members.md#edit-a-member-of-a-group-or-project)

   ```shell
   # to update a project membership
   curl --request PUT --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" --data '{"member_role_id": '$MEMBER_ROLE_ID', "access_level": 10}' "https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/$ID/members/$GUEST_USER_ID"

   # to update a group membership
   curl --request PUT --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" --data '{"member_role_id": '$MEMBER_ROLE_ID', "access_level": 10}' "https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/$ID/members/$GUEST_USER_ID"
   ```

   Where:

   - `$ID`: The `ID` or [URL-encoded path of the project or group](../api/rest/index.md#namespaced-path-encoding) associated with the membership receiving the custom role.
   - `$MEMBER_ROLE_ID`: The `ID` of the member role created in the previous section.
   - `$GUEST_USER_ID`: The `ID` of the Guest user receiving a custom role.

   Now the Guest+1 user can view code on all projects associated with this membership.

### Remove a custom role from a group member

To remove a custom role from a group member, use the [Group and Project Members API endpoint](../api/members.md#edit-a-member-of-a-group-or-project)
and pass an empty `member_role_id` value.

```shell
curl --request PUT --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" --data '{"member_role_id": "", "access_level": 10}' "https://example.gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/$GROUP_PATH/members/$GUEST_USER_ID"
```

Now the user is a regular Guest.

### Remove a custom role

Removing a custom role also removes all members with that custom role from
the group. If you decide to delete a custom role, you must re-add any users with that custom
role to the group.

To remove a custom role from a group, a group member with
the Owner role:

1. Optional. If the Owner does not know the `ID` of a custom
   role, finds that `ID` by making an [API request](../api/member_roles.md#list-all-member-roles-of-a-group).
1. Uses [the API](../api/member_roles.md#remove-member-role-of-a-group) to delete the custom role.

### Known issues

- Additional permissions can only be applied to users with the Guest role.
- If a user with a custom role is shared with a group or project, their custom role is not transferred over with them. The user has the regular Guest role in the new group or project.
- You cannot use an [Auditor user](../administration/auditor_users.md) as a template for a custom role.
