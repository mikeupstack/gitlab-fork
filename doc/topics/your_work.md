# Your work sidebar

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384342) in GitLab 15.9.

The **Your work** sidebar is a more focused view into the areas you have access to.

This sidebar is part of [a redesign effort](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9044)
that removes the top bar and enables more customization of your GitLab experience.
