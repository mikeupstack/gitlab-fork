# Pipelines for the GitLab project

Pipelines for [`gitlab-org/gitlab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) (as well as the `dev` instance's) is configured in the usual
[`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)
which itself includes files under
[`.gitlab/ci/`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/.gitlab/ci)
for easier maintenance.

We're striving to [dogfood](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/principles/#dogfooding)
GitLab [CI/CD features and best-practices](../../ci/yaml/index.md)
as much as possible.

## Predictive test jobs before a merge request is approved

**To reduce the pipeline cost and shorten the job duration, before a merge request is approved, the pipeline will run a predictive set of RSpec & Jest tests that are likely to fail for the merge request changes.**

After a merge request has been approved, the pipeline would contain the full RSpec & Jest tests. This will ensure that all tests
have been run before a merge request is merged.

### Overview of the GitLab project test dependency

To understand how the predictive test jobs are executed, we need to understand the dependency between
GitLab code (frontend and backend) and the respective tests (Jest and RSpec).
This dependency can be visualized in the following diagram:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph frontend
    fe["Frontend code"]--tested with-->jest
    end
    subgraph backend
    be["Backend code"]--tested with-->rspec
    end

    be--generates-->fixtures["frontend fixtures"]
    fixtures--used in-->jest
```

In summary:

- RSpec tests are dependent on the backend code.
- Jest tests are dependent on both frontend and backend code, the latter through the frontend fixtures.

### Predictive Tests Dashboards

- <https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/899368/EP---Predictive-testing-analysis>

### The `detect-tests` CI job

Most CI/CD pipelines for `gitlab-org/gitlab` will run a [`detect-tests` CI job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/0c6058def8f182b4a2410db5d08a9550b951b2d8/.gitlab/ci/setup.gitlab-ci.yml#L101-146) in the `prepare` stage to detect which backend/frontend tests should be run based on the files that changed in the given MR.

The `detect-tests` job will create many files that will contain the backend/frontend tests that should be run. Those files will be read in subsequent jobs in the pipeline, and only those tests will be executed.

### RSpec predictive jobs

#### Determining predictive RSpec test files in a merge request

To identify the RSpec tests that are likely to fail in a merge request, we use *static mappings* and *dynamic mappings*.

##### Static mappings

We use the [`test_file_finder` gem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/test_file_finder), with a static mapping maintained in the [`tests.yml` file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/tests.yml) for special cases that cannot
  be mapped via coverage tracing ([see where it's used](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/5ab06422826c0d69c615655982a6f969a7f3c6ea/tooling/lib/tooling/find_tests.rb#L17)).

The test mappings contain a map of each source files to a list of test files which is dependent of the source file.

##### Dynamic mappings

First, we use the [`test_file_finder` gem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/test_file_finder), with a dynamic mapping strategy from test coverage tracing (generated via the [`Crystalball` gem](https://github.com/toptal/crystalball))
  ([see where it's used](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/tooling/lib/tooling/find_tests.rb#L20)).

In addition to `test_file_finder`, we have added several advanced mappings to detect even more tests to run:

- [`FindChanges`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/28943cbd8b6d7e9a350d00e5ea5bb52123ee14a4/tooling/lib/tooling/find_changes.rb) ([!74003](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/74003))
  - Automatically detect Jest tests to run upon backend changes (via frontend fixtures)
- [`PartialToViewsMappings`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/28943cbd8b6d7e9a350d00e5ea5bb52123ee14a4/tooling/lib/tooling/mappings/partial_to_views_mappings.rb) ([#395016](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/395016))
  - Run view specs when Rails partials included in those views are changed in an MR
- [`JsToSystemSpecsMappings`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/28943cbd8b6d7e9a350d00e5ea5bb52123ee14a4/tooling/lib/tooling/mappings/js_to_system_specs_mappings.rb) ([#386754](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386754))
  - Run certain system specs if a JavaScript file was changed in an MR
- [`GraphqlBaseTypeMappings`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/28943cbd8b6d7e9a350d00e5ea5bb52123ee14a4/tooling/lib/tooling/mappings/graphql_base_type_mappings.rb) ([#386756](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386756))
  - If a GraphQL type class changed, we should try to identify the other GraphQL types that potentially include this type, and run their specs.
- [`ViewToSystemSpecsMappings`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/28943cbd8b6d7e9a350d00e5ea5bb52123ee14a4/tooling/lib/tooling/mappings/view_to_system_specs_mappings.rb) ([#395017](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/395017))
  - When a view gets changed, we try to find feature specs that would test that area of the code.
- [`ViewToJsMappings`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/8d7dfb7c043adf931128088b9ffab3b4a39af6f5/tooling/lib/tooling/mappings/view_to_js_mappings.rb) ([#386719](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386719))
  - If a JS file is changed, we should try to identify the system specs that are covering this JS component.
- [`FindFilesUsingFeatureFlags`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/tooling/lib/tooling/find_files_using_feature_flags.rb) ([#407366](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/407366))
  - If a feature flag was changed, we check which Ruby file is including that feature flag, and we add it to the list of changed files in the detect-tests CI job. The remainder of the job will then detect which frontend/backend tests should be run based on those changed files.

#### Exceptional cases

In addition, there are a few circumstances where we would always run the full RSpec tests:

- when the `pipeline:run-all-rspec` label is set on the merge request. This label will trigger all RSpec tests including those run in the `as-if-foss` jobs.
- when the `pipeline:mr-approved` label is set on the merge request, and if the code changes satisfy the `backend-patterns` rule. Note that this label is assigned by triage automation when the merge request is approved by any reviewer. It is not recommended to apply this label manually.
- when the merge request is created by an automation (for example, Gitaly update or MR targeting a stable branch)
- when the merge request is created in a security mirror
- when any CI configuration file is changed (for example, `.gitlab-ci.yml` or `.gitlab/ci/**/*`)

#### Have you encountered a problem with backend predictive tests?

If so, please have a look at [the Engineering Productivity RUNBOOK on predictive tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/engineering-productivity/team/-/blob/main/runbooks/predictive-tests.md) for instructions on how to act upon predictive tests issues. Additionally, if you identified any test selection gaps, please let `@gl-quality/eng-prod` know so that we can take the necessary steps to optimize test selections.

### Jest predictive jobs

#### Determining predictive Jest test files in a merge request

To identify the jest tests that are likely to fail in a merge request, we pass a list of all the changed files into `jest` using the [`--findRelatedTests`](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--findrelatedtests-spaceseparatedlistofsourcefiles) option.
In this mode, `jest` would resolve all the dependencies of related to the changed files, which include test files that have these files in the dependency chain.

#### Exceptional cases

In addition, there are a few circumstances where we would always run the full Jest tests:

- when the `pipeline:run-all-jest` label is set on the merge request
- when the merge request is created by an automation (for example, Gitaly update or MR targeting a stable branch)
- when the merge request is created in a security mirror
- when relevant CI configuration file is changed (`.gitlab/ci/rules.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.gitlab/ci/frontend.gitlab-ci.yml`)
- when any frontend dependency file is changed (for example, `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `config/webpack.config.js`, `config/helpers/**/*.js`)
- when any vendored JavaScript file is changed (for example, `vendor/assets/javascripts/**/*`)

The `rules` definitions for full Jest tests are defined at `.frontend:rules:jest` in
[`rules.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/42321b18b946c64d2f6f788c38844499a5ae9141/.gitlab/ci/rules.gitlab-ci.yml#L938-955).

#### Have you encountered a problem with frontend predictive tests?

If so, please have a look at [the Engineering Productivity RUNBOOK on predictive tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/engineering-productivity/team/-/blob/main/runbooks/predictive-tests.md) for instructions on how to act upon predictive tests issues.

### Fork pipelines

We run only the predictive RSpec & Jest jobs for fork pipelines, unless the `pipeline:run-all-rspec`
label is set on the MR. The goal is to reduce the CI/CD minutes consumed by fork pipelines.

See the [experiment issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/quality-engineering/team-tasks/-/issues/1170).

## Fail-fast job in merge request pipelines

To provide faster feedback when a merge request breaks existing tests, we implemented a fail-fast mechanism.

An `rspec fail-fast` job is added in parallel to all other `rspec` jobs in a merge
request pipeline. This job runs the tests that are directly related to the changes
in the merge request.

If any of these tests fail, the `rspec fail-fast` job fails, triggering a
`fail-pipeline-early` job to run. The `fail-pipeline-early` job:

- Cancels the currently running pipeline and all in-progress jobs.
- Sets pipeline to have status `failed`.

For example:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "prepare stage";
        A["detect-tests"]
    end

    subgraph "test stage";
        B["jest"];
        C["rspec migration"];
        D["rspec unit"];
        E["rspec integration"];
        F["rspec system"];
        G["rspec fail-fast"];
    end

    subgraph "post-test stage";
        Z["fail-pipeline-early"];
    end

    A --"artifact: list of test files"--> G
    G --"on failure"--> Z
```

The `rspec fail-fast` is a no-op if there are more than 10 test files related to the
merge request. This prevents `rspec fail-fast` duration from exceeding the average
`rspec` job duration and defeating its purpose.

This number can be overridden by setting a CI/CD variable named `RSPEC_FAIL_FAST_TEST_FILE_COUNT_THRESHOLD`.

## Re-run previously failed tests in merge request pipelines

In order to reduce the feedback time after resolving failed tests for a merge request, the `rspec rspec-pg13-rerun-previous-failed-tests`
and `rspec rspec-ee-pg13-rerun-previous-failed-tests` jobs run the failed tests from the previous MR pipeline.

This was introduced on August 25th 2021, with <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/69053>.

### How it works?

1. The `detect-previous-failed-tests` job (`prepare` stage) detects the test files associated with failed RSpec
   jobs from the previous MR pipeline.
1. The `rspec rspec-pg13-rerun-previous-failed-tests` and `rspec rspec-ee-pg13-rerun-previous-failed-tests` jobs
   will run the test files gathered by the `detect-previous-failed-tests` job.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "prepare stage";
        A["detect-previous-failed-tests"]
    end

    subgraph "test stage";
        B["rspec rspec-pg13-rerun-previous-failed-tests"];
        C["rspec rspec-ee-pg13-rerun-previous-failed-tests"];
    end

    A --"artifact: list of test files"--> B & C
```

## Merge Trains

### Why do we need to have a “stable” master branch to enable merge trains?

If the master branch is unstable (i.e. CI/CD pipelines for the master branch are failing frequently), all of the merge requests pipelines that were added AFTER a faulty merge request pipeline would have to be **cancelled** and **added back to the train**, which would create a lot of delays if the merge train is long.

### How stable does the master branch have to be for us to enable merge trains?

We don't have a specific number, but we need to have better numbers for flaky tests failures and infrastructure failures (see the [Master Broken Incidents RCA Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/1082465/Master-Broken-Incidents-Root-Cause-Analysis)).

### Could we gradually move to merge trains in our CI/CD configuration?

There was a proposal from a contributor, but the approach is not without some downsides: [see the original proposal and discussion](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/quality-engineering/team-tasks/-/issues/195#note_1117151994).

## Faster feedback for some merge requests

### Broken Master Fixes

When you need to [fix a broken `master`](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#resolution-of-broken-master), you can add the `pipeline:expedite` label to expedite the pipelines that run on the merge request.

Note that the merge request also needs to have the `master:broken` or `master:foss-broken` label set.

### Revert MRs

To make your Revert MRs faster, use the [revert MR template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Revert%20To%20Resolve%20Incident.md) **before** you create your merge request. It will apply the `pipeline:expedite` label and others that will expedite the pipelines that run on the merge request.

### The `pipeline:expedite` label

When this label is assigned, the following steps of the CI/CD pipeline are skipped:

- The `e2e:package-and-test` job.
- The `rspec:undercoverage` job.
- The entire [Review Apps process](../testing_guide/review_apps.md).

Apply the label to the merge request, and run a new pipeline for the MR.

## Test jobs

We have dedicated jobs for each [testing level](../testing_guide/testing_levels.md) and each job runs depending on the
changes made in your merge request.
If you want to force all the RSpec jobs to run regardless of your changes, you can add the `pipeline:run-all-rspec` label to the merge request.

WARNING:
Forcing all jobs on docs only related MRs would not have the prerequisite jobs and would lead to errors

### End-to-end jobs

The [`e2e:package-and-test`](../testing_guide/end_to_end/index.md#using-the-package-and-test-job) child pipeline
runs end-to-end jobs automatically depending on changes, and is manual in other cases.
See `.qa:rules:package-and-test` in
[`rules.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/rules.gitlab-ci.yml) for
the specific list of rules.

If you want to force `e2e:package-and-test` to run regardless of your changes, you can add the
`pipeline:run-all-e2e` label to the merge request.

Consult the [End-to-end Testing](../testing_guide/end_to_end/index.md) dedicated page for more information.

### Review app jobs

The [`start-review-app-pipeline`](../testing_guide/review_apps.md) child pipeline deploys a Review App and runs
end-to-end tests against it automatically depending on changes, and is manual in other cases.
See `.review:rules:start-review-app-pipeline` in
[`rules.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/rules.gitlab-ci.yml) for
the specific list of rules.

If you want to force a Review App to be deployed regardless of your changes, you can add the
`pipeline:run-review-app` label to the merge request.

Consult the [Review Apps](../testing_guide/review_apps.md) dedicated page for more information.

### As-if-FOSS jobs

The `* as-if-foss` jobs run the GitLab test suite "as if FOSS", meaning as if the jobs would run in the context
of `gitlab-org/gitlab-foss`. These jobs are only created in the following cases:

- when the `pipeline:run-as-if-foss` label is set on the merge request
- when the merge request is created in the `gitlab-org/security/gitlab` project
- when any CI configuration file is changed (for example, `.gitlab-ci.yml` or `.gitlab/ci/**/*`)

The `* as-if-foss` jobs are run in addition to the regular EE-context jobs. They have the `FOSS_ONLY='1'` variable
set and get the `ee/` folder removed before the tests start running.

The intent is to ensure that a change doesn't introduce a failure after `gitlab-org/gitlab` is synced to `gitlab-org/gitlab-foss`.

### As-if-JH cross project downstream pipeline

The `start-as-if-jh` job triggers a cross project downstream pipeline which
runs the GitLab test suite "as if JiHu", meaning as if the pipeline would run
in the context of [GitLab JH](../jh_features_review.md). These jobs are only
created in the following cases:

- when changes are made to feature flags
- when the `pipeline:run-as-if-jh` label is set on the merge request

This pipeline runs under the context of a generated branch in the
[GitLab JH validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation)
project, which is a mirror of the
[GitLab JH mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-jh-mirrors/gitlab).

The generated branch name is prefixed with `as-if-jh/` along with the branch
name in the merge request. This generated branch is based on the merge request
branch, additionally adding changes downloaded from the
[corresponding JH branch](#corresponding-jh-branch) on top to turn the whole
pipeline as if JiHu.

The intent is to ensure that a change doesn't introduce a failure after
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) is synchronized to
[GitLab JH](https://jihulab.com/gitlab-cn/gitlab).

#### When to consider applying `pipeline:run-as-if-jh` label

If a Ruby file is renamed and there's a corresponding [`prepend_mod` line](../jh_features_review.md#jh-features-based-on-ce-or-ee-features),
it's likely that GitLab JH is relying on it and requires a corresponding
change to rename the module or class it's prepending.

#### Corresponding JH branch

You can create a corresponding JH branch on [GitLab JH](https://jihulab.com/gitlab-cn/gitlab) by
appending `-jh` to the branch name. If a corresponding JH branch is found,
as-if-jh pipeline grabs files from the respective branch, rather than from the
default branch `main-jh`.

NOTE:
For now, CI will try to fetch the branch on the [GitLab JH mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-jh-mirrors/gitlab), so it might take some time for the new JH branch to propagate to the mirror.

NOTE:
While [GitLab JH validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation) is a mirror of
[GitLab JH mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-jh-mirrors/gitlab),
it does not include any corresponding JH branch beside the default `main-jh`.
This is why when we want to fetch corresponding JH branch we should fetch it
from the main mirror, rather than the validation project.

#### How as-if-JH pipeline was configured

The whole process looks like this:

NOTE:
We only run `sync-as-if-jh-branch` when there are dependencies changes.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph "JiHuLab.com"
    JH["gitlab-cn/gitlab"]
  end

  subgraph "GitLab.com"
    Mirror["gitlab-org/gitlab-jh-mirrors/gitlab"]

    subgraph MR["gitlab-org/gitlab merge request"]
      Add["add-jh-files job"]
      Prepare["prepare-as-if-jh-branch job"]
      Add --"download artifacts"--> Prepare
    end

    subgraph "gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation"
      Sync["(*optional) sync-as-if-jh-branch job on branch as-if-jh-code-sync"]
      Start["start-as-if-jh job on as-if-jh/* branch"]
      AsIfJH["as-if-jh pipeline"]
    end

    Mirror --"pull mirror with master and main-jh"--> gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation
    Mirror --"download JiHu files with ADD_JH_FILES_TOKEN"--> Add
    Prepare --"push as-if-jh branches with AS_IF_JH_TOKEN"--> Sync
    Sync --"push as-if-jh branches with AS_IF_JH_TOKEN"--> Start
    Start --> AsIfJH
  end

  JH --"pull mirror with corresponding JH branches"--> Mirror
```

##### Tokens set in the project variables

- `ADD_JH_FILES_TOKEN`: This is a [GitLab JH mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-jh-mirrors/gitlab)
  project token with `read_api` permission, to be able to download JiHu files.
- `AS_IF_JH_TOKEN`: This is a [GitLab JH validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation)
  project token with `write_repository` permission, to push generated `as-if-jh/*` branch.

##### How we generate the as-if-JH branch

First `add-jh-files` job will download the required JiHu files from the
corresponding JH branch, saving in artifacts. Next `prepare-as-if-jh-branch`
job will create a new branch from the merge request branch, commit the
changes, and finally push the branch to the
[validation project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation).

Optionally, if the merge requests have changes to the dependencies, we have an
additional step to run `sync-as-if-jh-branch` job to trigger a downstream
pipeline on [`as-if-jh-code-sync` branch](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation/-/blob/as-if-jh-code-sync/jh/.gitlab-ci.yml)
in the validation project. This job will perform the same process as
[JiHu code-sync](https://jihulab.com/gitlab-cn/code-sync/-/blob/main-jh/.gitlab-ci.yml), making sure the dependencies changes can be brought to the
as-if-jh branch prior to run the validation pipeline.

If there are no dependencies changes, we don't run this process.

##### How we trigger and run the as-if-JH pipeline

After having the `as-if-jh/*` branch prepared and optionally synchronized,
`start-as-if-jh` job will trigger a pipeline in the
[validation project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation)
to run the cross-project downstream pipeline.

##### How the GitLab JH mirror project is set up

The [GitLab JH mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-jh-mirrors/gitlab) project is private and CI is disabled.

It's a pull mirror pulling from [GitLab JH](https://jihulab.com/gitlab-cn/gitlab),
mirroring all branches, overriding divergent refs, triggering no pipelines
when mirror is updated.

The pulling user is [`@gitlab-jh-bot`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-jh-bot), who
is a maintainer in the project. The credentials can be found in the 1password
engineering vault.

No password is used from mirroring because GitLab JH is a public project.

##### How the GitLab JH validation project is set up

This [GitLab JH validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation) project is public and CI is enabled, without any project variables.

It's a pull mirror pulling from [GitLab JH mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-jh-mirrors/gitlab),
mirroring only protected branches, `master` and `main-jh`, overriding
divergent refs, triggering no pipelines when mirror is updated.

The pulling user is [`@gitlab-jh-validation-bot`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-jh-validation-bot), who is a maintainer in the project, and also a
reporter in the
[GitLab JH mirror](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-jh-mirrors/gitlab).
The credentials can be found in the 1password engineering vault.

A personal access token from `@gitlab-jh-validation-bot` with
`write_repository` permission is used as the password to pull changes from
the GitLab JH mirror. Username is set with `gitlab-jh-validation-bot`.

There is also a [pipeline schedule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation/-/pipeline_schedules)
to run maintenance pipelines with variable `SCHEDULE_TYPE` set to `maintenance`
running every day, updating cache.

The default CI/CD configuration file is also set at `jh/.gitlab-ci.yml` so it
runs exactly like [GitLab JH](https://jihulab.com/gitlab-cn/gitlab/-/blob/main-jh/jh/.gitlab-ci.yml).

Additionally, a special branch
[`as-if-jh-code-sync`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org-sandbox/gitlab-jh-validation/-/blob/as-if-jh-code-sync/jh/.gitlab-ci.yml)
is set and protected. Maintainers can push and developers can merge for this
branch. We need to set it so developers can merge because we need to let
developers to trigger pipelines for this branch. This is a compromise
before we resolve [Developer-level users no longer able to run pipelines on protected branches](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/230939).

It's used to run `sync-as-if-jh-branch` to synchronize the dependencies
when the merge requests changed the dependencies. See
[How we generate the as-if-JH branch](#how-we-generate-the-as-if-jh-branch)
for how it works.

### `rspec:undercoverage` job

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/74859) in GitLab 14.6.

The `rspec:undercoverage` job runs [`undercover`](https://rubygems.org/gems/undercover)
to detect, and fail if any changes introduced in the merge request has zero coverage.

The `rspec:undercoverage` job obtains coverage data from the `rspec:coverage`
job.

If the `rspec:undercoverage` job detects missing coverage due to a CE method being overridden in EE, add the `pipeline:run-as-if-foss` label to the merge request and start a new pipeline.

In the event of an emergency, or false positive from this job, add the
`pipeline:skip-undercoverage` label to the merge request to allow this job to
fail.

#### Troubleshooting `rspec:undercoverage` failures

The `rspec:undercoverage` job has [known bugs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8254)
that can cause false positive failures. You can test coverage locally to determine if it's
safe to apply `pipeline:skip-undercoverage`. For example, using `<spec>` as the name of the
test causing the failure:

1. Run `SIMPLECOV=1 bundle exec rspec <spec>`.
1. Run `scripts/undercoverage`.

If these commands return `undercover: ✅ No coverage is missing in latest changes` then you can apply `pipeline:skip-undercoverage` to bypass pipeline failures.

## Test suite parallelization

Our current RSpec tests parallelization setup is as follows:

1. The `retrieve-tests-metadata` job in the `prepare` stage ensures we have a
   `knapsack/report-master.json` file:
   - The `knapsack/report-master.json` file is fetched from the latest `main` pipeline which runs `update-tests-metadata`
     (for now it's the 2-hourly `maintenance` scheduled master pipeline), if it's not here we initialize the file with `{}`.
1. Each `[rspec|rspec-ee] [migration|unit|integration|system|geo] n m` job are run with
   `knapsack rspec` and should have an evenly distributed share of tests:
   - It works because the jobs have access to the `knapsack/report-master.json`
     since the "artifacts from all previous stages are passed by default".
   - the jobs set their own report path to
     `"knapsack/${TEST_TOOL}_${TEST_LEVEL}_${DATABASE}_${CI_NODE_INDEX}_${CI_NODE_TOTAL}_report.json"`.
   - if knapsack is doing its job, test files that are run should be listed under
     `Report specs`, not under `Leftover specs`.
1. The `update-tests-metadata` job (which only runs on scheduled pipelines for
   [the canonical project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) takes all the
   `knapsack/rspec*.json` files and merge them all together into a single
   `knapsack/report-master.json` file that is saved as artifact.

After that, the next pipeline uses the up-to-date `knapsack/report-master.json` file.

## Flaky tests

### Automatic skipping of flaky tests

We used to skip tests that are [known to be flaky](../testing_guide/flaky_tests.md#automatic-retries-and-flaky-tests-detection),
but we stopped doing so since that could actually lead to actual broken `master`.
Instead, we introduced
[a fast-quarantining process](../testing_guide/flaky_tests.md#fast-quarantine)
to proactively quarantine any flaky test reported in `#master-broken` incidents.

This fast-quarantining process can be disabled by setting the `$FAST_QUARANTINE`
variable to `false`.

### Automatic retry of failing tests in a separate process

Unless `$RETRY_FAILED_TESTS_IN_NEW_PROCESS` variable is set to `false` (`true` by default), RSpec tests that failed are automatically retried once in a separate
RSpec process. The goal is to get rid of most side-effects from previous tests that may lead to a subsequent test failure.

We keep track of retried tests in the `$RETRIED_TESTS_REPORT_FILE` file saved as artifact by the `rspec:flaky-tests-report` job.

See the [experiment issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/quality-engineering/team-tasks/-/issues/1148).

## Compatibility testing

By default, we run all tests with the versions that runs on GitLab.com.

Other versions (usually one back-compatible version, and one forward-compatible version) should be running in nightly scheduled pipelines.

Exceptions to this general guideline should be motivated and documented.

### Ruby versions testing

We're running Ruby 3.0 on GitLab.com, as well as for merge requests and the default branch.
However, there are older versions for which we need to support Ruby 2.7, so we also run our
test suite against Ruby 2.7 on a dedicated 2-hourly scheduled pipelines.

For merge requests, you can add the `pipeline:run-in-ruby2` label to switch
the Ruby version used for running the whole test suite to 2.7. When you do
this, the test suite will no longer run in Ruby 3.0 (default), and an
additional job `verify-ruby-3.0` will also run and always fail to remind us to
remove the label and run in Ruby 3.0 before merging the merge request.

This should let us:

- Test changes for Ruby 2.7
- Make sure it will not break anything when it's merged into the default branch

### PostgreSQL versions testing

Our test suite runs against PG13 as GitLab.com runs on PG13 and
[Omnibus defaults to PG13 for new installs and upgrades](../../administration/package_information/postgresql_versions.md).

We do run our test suite against PG13 on nightly scheduled pipelines.

We also run our test suite against PG13 upon specific database library changes in MRs and `main` pipelines (with the `rspec db-library-code pg13` job).

#### Current versions testing

| Where?                                                                                         | PostgreSQL version                              | Ruby version          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Merge requests                                                                                 | 13 (default version), 12 for DB library changes | 3.0 (default version) |
| `master` branch commits                                                                        | 13 (default version), 12 for DB library changes | 3.0 (default version) |
| `maintenance` scheduled pipelines for the `master` branch (every even-numbered hour)           | 13 (default version), 12 for DB library changes | 3.0 (default version) |
| `maintenance` scheduled pipelines for the `ruby2` branch (every odd-numbered hour), see below. | 13 (default version), 12 for DB library changes | 2.7                   |
| `nightly` scheduled pipelines for the `master` branch                                          | 13 (default version), 12, 14 | 3.0 (default version) |

There are 2 pipeline schedules used for testing Ruby 2.7. One is triggering a
pipeline in `ruby2-sync` branch, which updates the `ruby2` branch with latest
`master`, and no pipelines will be triggered by this push. The other schedule
is triggering a pipeline in `ruby2` 5 minutes after it, which is considered
the maintenance schedule to run test suites and update cache.

The `ruby2` branch must not have any changes. The branch is only there to set
`RUBY_VERSION` to `2.7` in the maintenance pipeline schedule.

The `gitlab` job in the `ruby2-sync` branch uses a `gitlab-org/gitlab` project
token with `write_repository` scope and `Maintainer` role with no expiration.
The token is stored in the `RUBY2_SYNC_TOKEN` variable in `gitlab-org/gitlab`.

### Redis versions testing

Our test suite runs against Redis 6 as GitLab.com runs on Redis 6 and
[Omnibus defaults to Redis 6 for new installs and upgrades](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/blob/master/config/software/redis.rb).

We do run our test suite against Redis 5 on `nightly` scheduled pipelines, specifically when running backward-compatible and forward-compatible PostgreSQL jobs.

#### Current versions testing

| Where? | Redis version |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| MRs    | 6 |
| `default branch` (non-scheduled pipelines) | 6 |
| `nightly` scheduled pipelines | 5 |

### Single database testing

By default, all tests run with [multiple databases](../database/multiple_databases.md).

We also run tests with a single database in nightly scheduled pipelines, and in merge requests that touch database-related files.

Single database tests run in two modes:

1. **Single database with one connection**. Where GitLab connects to all the tables using one connection pool.
This runs through all the jobs that end with `-single-db`
1. **Single database with two connections**. Where GitLab connects to `gitlab_main`, `gitlab_ci` database tables
using different database connections. This runs through all the jobs that end with `-single-db-ci-connection`.

If you want to force tests to run with a single database, you can add the `pipeline:run-single-db` label to the merge request.

## Monitoring

The GitLab test suite is [monitored](../performance.md#rspec-profiling) for the `main` branch, and any branch
that includes `rspec-profile` in their name.

## Logging

- Rails logging to `log/test.log` is disabled by default in CI
  [for performance reasons](https://jtway.co/speed-up-your-rails-test-suite-by-6-in-1-line-13fedb869ec4).
  To override this setting, provide the
  `RAILS_ENABLE_TEST_LOG` environment variable.

## Pipelines types for merge requests

In general, pipelines for an MR fall into one of the following types (from shorter to longer), depending on the changes made in the MR:

- [Documentation pipeline](#documentation-pipeline): For MRs that touch documentation.
- [Backend pipeline](#backend-pipeline): For MRs that touch backend code.
- [Review app pipeline](#review-app-pipeline): For MRs that touch frontend code.
- [End-to-end pipeline](#end-to-end-pipeline): For MRs that touch code in the `qa/` folder.

A "pipeline type" is an abstract term that mostly describes the "critical path" (for example, the chain of jobs for which the sum
of individual duration equals the pipeline's duration).
We use these "pipeline types" in [metrics dashboards](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/858266/GitLab-Pipeline-Durations) to detect what types and jobs need to be optimized first.

An MR that touches multiple areas would be associated with the longest type applicable. For instance, an MR that touches backend
and frontend would fall into the "Frontend" pipeline type since this type takes longer to finish than the "Backend" pipeline type.

We use the [`rules:`](../../ci/yaml/index.md#rules) and [`needs:`](../../ci/yaml/index.md#needs) keywords extensively
to determine the jobs that need to be run in a pipeline. Note that an MR that includes multiple types of changes would
have a pipelines that include jobs from multiple types (for example, a combination of docs-only and code-only pipelines).

Following are graphs of the critical paths for each pipeline type. Jobs that aren't part of the critical path are omitted.
