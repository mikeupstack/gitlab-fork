# Jira issue integration **(FREE)**

The Jira issue integration connects one or more GitLab projects to a Jira instance. You can host the Jira instance yourself or in [Jira Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/why-cloud). The supported Jira versions are `6.x`, `7.x`, `8.x`, and `9.x`.

## Configure the integration

Prerequisites:

- Your GitLab installation must not use a [relative URL](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#configure-a-relative-url-for-gitlab).
- **For Jira Server**, you must have a Jira username and password.
- **For Jira Cloud**, you must have a [Jira Cloud API token](#create-a-jira-cloud-api-token) and
  the email address you used to create the token.

You can enable the Jira issue integration by configuring your project settings in GitLab.
You can also configure these settings at the:

- [Group level](../../user/admin_area/settings/project_integration_management.md#manage-group-level-default-settings-for-a-project-integration)
- [Instance level](../../user/admin_area/settings/project_integration_management.md#manage-instance-level-default-settings-for-a-project-integration) for self-managed GitLab

To configure your project settings in GitLab:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **Jira**.
1. Select **Enable integration**.
1. Select **Trigger** actions. Your choice determines whether a mention of Jira issue
   (in a GitLab commit, merge request, or both) creates a cross-link in Jira back to GitLab.
1. To comment in the Jira issue when a **Trigger** action is made in GitLab, select
   **Enable comments**.
1. To transition Jira issues when a
   [closing reference](../../user/project/issues/managing_issues.md#closing-issues-automatically)
   is made in GitLab, select **Enable Jira transitions**.
1. Provide Jira configuration information:
   - **Web URL**: The base URL to the Jira instance web interface you're linking to
     this GitLab project, such as `https://jira.example.com`.
   - **Jira API URL**: The base URL to the Jira instance API, such as `https://jira-api.example.com`.
     Defaults to the **Web URL** value if not set. Leave blank if using **Jira on Atlassian cloud**.
   - **Username or Email**:
     For **Jira Server**, use `username`. For **Jira on Atlassian cloud**, use `email`.
   - **Password/API token**:
     Use `password` for **Jira Server** or `API token` for **Jira on Atlassian cloud**.
1. To enable users to [view Jira issues](issues.md#view-jira-issues) inside the GitLab project, select **Enable Jira issues** and
   enter a Jira project key.

   You can display issues only from a single Jira project in a given GitLab project.

   WARNING:
   If you enable Jira issues with this setting, all users with access to this GitLab project
   can view all issues from the specified Jira project.

1. To enable [issue creation for vulnerabilities](../../user/application_security/vulnerabilities/index.md#create-a-jira-issue-for-a-vulnerability), select **Enable Jira issue creation from vulnerabilities**.
1. Select the **Jira issue type**. If the dropdown list is empty, select refresh (**{retry}**) and try again.
1. To verify the Jira connection is working, select **Test settings**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

Your GitLab project can now interact with all Jira projects in your instance and the project now
displays a Jira link that opens the Jira project.

## Create a Jira Cloud API token

To configure the integration with Jira Cloud, you must create a Jira Cloud API token.

To create a Jira Cloud API token:

1. Sign in to [Atlassian](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
   from an account with **write** access to Jira projects.

   The link opens the **API tokens** page. Alternatively, from your Atlassian
   profile, select **Account Settings > Security > Create and manage API tokens**.

1. Select **Create API token**.
1. In the dialog, enter a label for your token and select **Create**.

To copy the API token, select **Copy** and paste the token somewhere safe.

## Migrate from Jira Server to Jira Cloud in GitLab

To migrate from Jira Server to Jira Cloud in GitLab and maintain your Jira integration:

1. On the top bar, select **Main menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select **Jira**.
1. In **Web URL**, enter the new Jira site URL (for example, `https://myjirasite.atlassian.net`).
1. In **Username or Email**, enter the username or email registered on your Jira profile.
1. [Create a Jira Cloud API token](#create-a-jira-cloud-api-token), and copy the token value.
1. In **Password or API token**, paste the API token value.
1. Optional. Select **Test settings** to check if the connection is working.
1. Select **Save changes**.

To update existing Jira issue references in GitLab to use the new Jira site URL, you must [invalidate the Markdown cache](../../administration/invalidate_markdown_cache.md#invalidate-the-cache).
