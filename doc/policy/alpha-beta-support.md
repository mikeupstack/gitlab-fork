# Support for Experiment, Beta, and Generally Available features **(PREMIUM)**

Some GitLab features are released as Experiment or Beta versions and are
[not fully supported](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#alpha-beta-features).
All other features are considered to be Generally Available (GA).

## Experiment

Support is not provided for features listed as "Experimental" or "Alpha" or any similar designation. Issues regarding such features should be opened in the GitLab issue tracker.

- Not ready for production use.
- No support available.
- May be unstable or have performance issues.
- Can be removed at any time.
- Data loss may occur.
- Documentation may not exist or just be in a blog format.
- Behind a feature flag that is on by default and the UI reflects Experiment status.
- Behind a toggle that is off by default and the UI reflects Experiment status.
- Feedback issue to engage with team.
- UX not finalized, might be just quick action access.
- Not announced in a release post.

## Beta

Commercially-reasonable efforts are made to provide limited support for features designated as "Beta," with the expectation that issues require extra time and assistance from development to troubleshoot.

- May not be ready for production use and the UI and documentation will reflect this status.
- May be unstable and can cause performance and stability issues.
- Configuration and dependencies unlikely to change.
- Features and functions unlikely to change. However, breaking changes may occur outside of major releases or with less notice than for Generally Available features.
- Data loss not likely.
- Support on a commercially-reasonable effort basis.
- Documentation reflects Beta status.
- UX complete or near completion.
- Behind a feature flag that is on by default and the UI reflects Beta status.
- Behind a toggle that is off by default and the UI reflects Beta status.
- Can be announced in a release post that reflects Beta status.

## Generally Available (GA)

Generally Available features means that they passed the [Production Readiness Review](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/readiness/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/production_readiness.md) for GitLab.com, and are:

- Ready for production use at any scale.
- Fully documented and supported.
- UX complete and in line with GitLab design standards.

## Never internal

Features are never internal (GitLab team-members) only.
Our [mission is "everyone can contribute"](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/), and that is only possible if people outside the company can try a feature.
We will get higher quality (more diverse) feedback if people from different organizations try something.
We've also learned that internal only as a state slows us down more than it speeds us up.
Release the experiment instead of testing internally or waiting for the feature to be in a Beta state.
The experimental features are only shown when people/organizations opt-in to experiments, we are allowed to make mistakes here and literally experiment.
