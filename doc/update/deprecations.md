### Atlassian Crowd OmniAuth provider

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.3</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

The `omniauth_crowd` gem that provides GitLab with the Atlassian Crowd OmniAuth provider will be removed in our
next major release, GitLab 16.0. This gem sees very little use and its
[lack of compatibility](https://github.com/robdimarco/omniauth_crowd/issues/37) with OmniAuth 2.0 is
[blocking our upgrade](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30073).

### Auto DevOps support for Herokuish is deprecated

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Auto DevOps support for Herokuish is deprecated in favor of [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/stages.html#auto-build-using-cloud-native-buildpacks). You should [migrate your builds from Herokuish to Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/stages.html#moving-from-herokuish-to-cloud-native-buildpacks). From GitLab 14.0, Auto Build uses Cloud Native Buildpacks by default.

Because Cloud Native Buildpacks do not support automatic testing, the Auto Test feature of Auto DevOps is also deprecated.

### DAST ZAP advanced configuration variables deprecation

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.7</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

With the new browser-based DAST analyzer GA in GitLab 15.7, we are working towards making it the default DAST analyzer at some point in the future. In preparation for this, the following legacy DAST variables are being deprecated and scheduled for removal in GitLab 17.0: `DAST_ZAP_CLI_OPTIONS` and `DAST_ZAP_LOG_CONFIGURATION`. These variables allowed for advanced configuration of the legacy DAST analyzer, which was based on OWASP ZAP. The new browser-based analyzer will not include the same functionality, as these were specific to how ZAP worked.

These three variables will be removed in GitLab 17.0.

### Deprecate legacy shell escaping and quoting runner shell executor

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.11</span>
- End of Support: GitLab <span class="milestone">17.9</span>
</div>

The runner's legacy escape sequence mechanism to handle variable expansion implements a sub-optimal implementation of Ansi-C quoting. This method means that the runner would expand arguments included in double quotes. As of 15.11, we are deprecating the legacy escaping and quoting methods in the runner shell executor.

### Filepath field in Releases and Release Links APIs

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.9</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Support for specifying a `filepath` for a direct asset link in the [Releases API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases)
and [Release Links API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/links.html) is deprecated in GitLab 15.9 and will be
removed in GitLab 17.0. GitLab introduced a new field called `direct_asset_path` in GitLab 15.9 to replace `filepath`
until it is finally removed.

To avoid any disruptions, you should replace `filepath` with `direct_asset_path` in your calls to the following endpoints:

- Releases API:
  - [Create a release](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/#create-a-release)
  - [Download a release asset](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/#download-a-release-asset)

### GitLab Helm chart values `gitlab.kas.privateApi.*` are deprecated

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

We introduced the `global.kas.tls.*` Helm values to facilitate TLS communication between KAS and your Helm chart components.
The old values `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.enabled` and `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.secretName` are deprecated and scheduled for removal in GitLab 17.0.

Because the new values provide a streamlined, comprehensive method to enable TLS for KAS, you should use `global.kas.tls.*` instead of `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.*`. The `gitlab.kas.privateApi.tls.*` For more information, see:

- The [merge request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2888) that introduces the `global.kas.tls.*` values.

The [`runner-registration-token`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/operator.html#install-the-kubernetes-operator) parameter that uses the OpenShift and k8s Vanilla Operator to install a runner on Kubernetes is deprecated.
We plan to implement a new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance

### Queue selector for running Sidekiq is deprecated

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.9</span>
- End of Support: GitLab <span class="milestone">16.0</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Running Sidekiq with a [queue selector](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.html#queue-selectors) (having multiple processes listening to a set of queues) and [negate settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.html#negate-settings) is deprecated and will be fully removed in 17.0.

You can migrate away from queue selectors to [listening to all queues in all processes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/sidekiq/extra_sidekiq_processes.html#start-multiple-processes). For example, if Sidekiq is currently running with 4 processes (denoted by 4 elements in `sidekiq['queue_groups']` in `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`) with queue selector (`sidekiq['queue_selector'] = true`), you can change Sidekiq to listen to all queues in all 4 processes,for example `sidekiq['queue_groups'] = ['*'] * 4`. This approach is also recommended in our [Reference Architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/5k_users.html#configure-sidekiq). Note that Sidekiq can effectively run as many processes as the number of CPUs in the machine.

While the above approach is recommended for most instances, Sidekiq can also be run using [routing rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.html#routing-rules) which is also being used on GitLab.com. You can follow the [migration guide from queue selectors to routing rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/sidekiq/processing_specific_job_classes.html#migrating-from-queue-selectors-to-routing-rules). You need to take care with the migration to avoid losing jobs entirely.

### Registration tokens and server-side runner arguments in `POST /api/v4/runners` endpoint

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.6</span>
- End of Support: GitLab <span class="milestone">17.0</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

The support for registration tokens and certain runner configuration arguments in the `POST` method operation on the `/api/v4/runners` endpoint is deprecated.
This endpoint [registers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#register-a-new-runner) a runner
with a GitLab instance at the instance, group, or project level through the API. We plan to remove the support for
registration tokens and certain configuration arguments in this endpoint in GitLab 17.0.

We plan to implement a new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance
as part of the new [GitLab Runner token architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/runner_tokens/).
The work is planned in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7633).
This new architecture introduces a new method for registering runners and will eliminate the legacy
[runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#runner-registration-tokens).
From GitLab 17.0 and later, the runner registration methods implemented by the new GitLab Runner token architecture will be the only supported methods.

- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Required Pipeline Configuration will be removed in the 17.0 release. This impacts self-managed users on the Ultimate license.

We recommend replacing this with an alternative [compliance solution](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/compliance_frameworks.html#compliance-pipelines)
that is available now. We recommend this alternative solution because it provides greater flexibility, allowing required pipelines to be assigned to specific compliance framework labels.

### Self-managed certificate-based integration with Kubernetes

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.5</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

The certificate-based integration with Kubernetes [will be deprecated and removed](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/).

As a self-managed customer, we are introducing the [feature flag](../administration/feature_flags.md#enable-or-disable-the-feature) `certificate_based_clusters` in GitLab 15.0 so you can keep your certificate-based integration enabled. However, the feature flag will be disabled by default, so this change is a **breaking change**.

In GitLab 17.0 we will remove both the feature and its related code. Until the final removal in 17.0, features built on this integration will continue to work, if you enable the feature flag. Until the feature is removed, GitLab will continue to fix security and critical issues as they arise.

For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, we recommend you use the
[agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab. [How do I migrate?](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent.html)

Although an explicit removal date is set, we don't plan to remove this feature until the new solution has feature parity.
For more information about the blockers to removal, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/199).

</div>

Previously, [GitLab's database](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html)
configuration had a single `main:` section. This is being deprecated. The new
configuration has both a `main:` and a `ci:` section.

This deprecation affects users compiling GitLab from source, who will need
to [add the `ci:` section](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/installation.html#configure-gitlab-db-settings).
Omnibus, the Helm chart, and Operator will handle this configuration

integration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372411).
GitLab.com users can now use the GitLab for Slack app to manage notifications

The support for runner registration tokens is deprecated. As a consequence, the REST API endpoints to reset a registration token are also deprecated and will
be removed in GitLab 17.0.
The deprecated endpoints are:

- `POST /runners/reset_registration_token`
- `POST /projects/:id/runners/reset_registration_token`
- `POST /groups/:id/runners/reset_registration_token`

We plan to implement a new method to bind runners to a GitLab instance

The [`gitlab-runner exec`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/commands/#gitlab-runner-exec) command is deprecated and will be fully removed from GitLab Runner in 16.0. The `gitlab-runner exec` feature was initially developed to provide the ability to validate a GitLab CI pipeline on a local system without needing to commit the updates to a GitLab instance. However, with the continued evolution of GitLab CI, replicating all GitLab CI features into `gitlab-runner exec` was no longer viable. Pipeline syntax and validation [simulation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipeline_editor/#simulate-a-cicd-pipeline) are available in the GitLab pipeline editor.

In some cases, like when a downstream pipeline had the `passed with warnings` status, trigger jobs that were using [`strategy: depend`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#strategydepend) did not mirror the status of the downstream pipeline exactly. In GitLab 17.0 trigger jobs will show the exact same status as the the downstream pipeline.

</div>

The [Error Tracking UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html) is deprecated in 15.9 and will be removed in 16.6 (milestone might change) once GitLab Observability UI is made available. In future versions, you should use the [GitLab Observability UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/opstrace/opstrace-ui/), which will gradually be made available on GitLab.com over the next few releases.

During the transition to the GitLab Observability UI, we will migrate the [GitLab Observability Backend](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/opstrace/opstrace) from a per-cluster deployment model to a per-tenant deployment model. Because [Integrated Error Tracking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html#integrated-error-tracking) is in Open Beta, we will not migrate any existing user data. For more details about the migration, see the direction pages for:

In GitLab 16.0, databases will be provisioned only for users who opt in. This
change supports production deployments that require more robust database management.

If you want Auto DevOps to provision an in-cluster database,
set the `POSTGRES_ENABLED` CI/CD variable to `true`.

### Azure Storage Driver defaults to the correct root prefix

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

The Azure Storage Driver writes to `//` as the default root directory. This default root directory appears in some places within the Azure UI as `/<no-name>/`. We have maintained this legacy behavior to support older deployments using this storage driver. However, when moving to Azure from another storage driver, this behavior hides all your data until you configure the storage driver to build root paths without an extra leading slash by setting `trimlegacyrootprefix: true`.

The new default configuration for the storage driver will set `trimlegacyrootprefix: true`, and `/` will be the default root directory. You can add `trimlegacyrootprefix: false` to your current configuration to avoid any disruptions.

This breaking change will happen in GitLab 16.0.

The Grafana Helm chart that is bundled with the GitLab Helm Chart is deprecated and will be removed in the GitLab Helm Chart 7.0 release (releasing along with GitLab 16.0).

The bundled Grafana Helm chart is an optional service that can be turned on to provide the Grafana UI connected to the GitLab Helm Chart's Prometheus metrics.

The version of Grafana that the GitLab Helm Chart is currently providing is no longer a supported Grafana version.
If you're using the bundled Grafana, you should switch to the [newer chart version from Grafana Labs](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/grafana/grafana)

### Default CI/CD job token (`CI_JOB_TOKEN`) scope changed

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.9</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

In GitLab 14.4 we introduced the ability to [limit your project's CI/CD job token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#limit-your-projects-job-token-access) (`CI_JOB_TOKEN`) access to make it more secure. You can prevent job tokens **from your project's** pipelines from being used to **access other projects**. When enabled with no other configuration, your pipelines cannot access other projects. To use the job token to access other projects from your pipeline, you must list those projects explicitly in the **Limit CI_JOB_TOKEN access** setting's allowlist, and you must be a maintainer in all the projects.

The job token functionality was updated in 15.9 with a better security setting to [allow access to your project with a job token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#allow-access-to-your-project-with-a-job-token). When enabled with no other configuration, job tokens **from other projects** cannot **access your project**. Similar to the older setting, you can optionally allow other projects to access your project with a job token if you list those projects explicitly in the **Allow access to this project with a CI_JOB_TOKEN** setting's allowlist. With this new setting, you must be a maintainer in your own project, but only need to have the Guest role in the other projects.

As a result, the **Limit** setting is deprecated in preference of the better **Allow access** setting. In GitLab 16.0 the **Limit** setting will be disabled by default for all new projects. In projects with this setting currently enabled, it will continue to function as expected, but you will not be able to add any more projects to the allowlist. If the setting is disabled in any project, it will not be possible to re-enable this setting in 16.0 or later.

In 17.0, we plan to remove the **Limit** setting completely, and set the **Allow access** setting to enabled for all projects. This change ensures a higher level of security between projects. If you currently use the **Limit** setting, you should update your projects to use the **Allow access** setting instead. If other projects access your project with a job token, you must add them to the **Allow access** allowlist.

To prepare for this change, users on GitLab.com or self-managed GitLab 15.9 or later can enable the **Allow access** setting now and add the other projects. It will not be possible to disable the setting in 17.0 or later.

As part of our effort to improve the security of your CI workflows using JWT and OIDC, the native HashiCorp integration is also being updated in GitLab 16.0. Any projects that use the [`secrets:vault`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#secretsvault) keyword to retrieve secrets from Vault will need to be [configured to use ID tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html#configure-automatic-id-token-authentication).

To be prepared for this change, you should do the following before GitLab 16.0:

- [Disable the use of JSON web tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html#enable-automatic-id-token-authentication) in the pipeline.
- Ensure the bound audience is prefixed with `https://`.
- Use the new [`id_tokens`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#id_tokens) keyword

The GitLab [License Compliance](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/license_compliance/) CI template is now deprecated and is scheduled for removal in the GitLab 16.0 release. Users who wish to continue using GitLab for License Compliance should remove the License Compliance template from their CI pipeline and add the [Dependency Scanning template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuration). The Dependency Scanning template is now capable of gathering the required license information so it is no longer necessary to run a separate License Compliance job. The License Compliance CI template should not be removed prior to verifying that the `license_scanning_sbom_scanner` and `package_metadata_synchronization` flags are enabled for the instance and that the instance has been upgraded to a version that supports [the new method of license scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/license_scanning_of_cyclonedx_files/).

</div>

Access tokens that have no expiration date are valid indefinitely, which presents a security risk if the access token
is divulged. Because access tokens that have an exipiration date are better, from GitLab 15.3 we
[populate a default expiration date](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348660).

In GitLab 16.0, any [personal](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html),
[project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html), or
[group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) access token that does not have an
expiration date will automatically have an expiration date set at one year.

We recommend giving your access tokens an expiration date in line with your company's security policies before the
default is applied:

- On GitLab.com during the 16.0 milestone.
- On GitLab self-managed instances when they are upgraded to 16.0.

The [Rake task for importing bare repositories](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/import.html) `gitlab:import:repos` is deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and will be removed in GitLab 16.0.

This Rake task imports a directory tree of repositories into a GitLab instance. These repositories must have been
managed by GitLab previously, because the Rake task relies on the specific directory structure or a specific custom Git setting in order to work (`gitlab.fullpath`).

Importing repositories using this Rake task has limitations. The Rake task:

- Only knows about project and project wiki repositories and doesn't support repositories for designs, group wikis, or snippets.
- Permits you to import non-hashed storage projects even though these aren't supported.
- Relies on having Git config `gitlab.fullpath` set. [Epic 8953](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8953) proposes removing support for this setting.

Alternatives to using the `gitlab:import:repos` Rake task include:

### SAST analyzer coverage changing in GitLab 16.0

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.9</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

GitLab SAST uses various [analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/) to scan code for vulnerabilities.

We're reducing the number of supported analyzers used by default in GitLab SAST.
This is part of our long-term strategy to deliver a faster, more consistent user experience across different programming languages.

Starting in GitLab 16.0, the GitLab SAST CI/CD template will no longer use the following analyzers, and they will enter End of Support status:

- [Security Code Scan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/security-code-scan) (.NET)
- [PHPCS Security Audit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/phpcs-security-audit) (PHP)

We'll remove these analyzers from the [SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) and replace them with GitLab-supported detection rules and the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).
Effective immediately, these analyzers will receive only security updates; other routine improvements or updates are not guaranteed.
After these analyzers reach End of Support, no further updates will be provided.
However, we won't delete container images previously published for these analyzers or remove the ability to run them by using a custom CI/CD pipeline job.

We will also remove Scala from the scope of the [SpotBugs-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs) and replace it with the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).
This change will make it simpler to scan Scala code; compilation will no longer be required.
This change will be reflected in the automatic language detection portion of the [GitLab-managed SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml).
Note that the SpotBugs-based analyzer will continue to cover Groovy and Kotlin.

If you've already dismissed a vulnerability finding from one of the deprecated analyzers, the replacement attempts to respect your previous dismissal. The system behavior depends on:

- whether you've excluded the Semgrep-based analyzer from running in the past.
- which analyzer first discovered the vulnerabilities shown in the project's Vulnerability Report.

See [Vulnerability translation documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers.html#vulnerability-translation) for further details.

If you applied customizations to any of the affected analyzers or if you currently disable the Semgrep analyzer in your pipelines, you must take action as detailed in the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390416#breaking-change).

If you are not using the default included templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions you will need to update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or to update the latest major version.
Users of GitLab 13.0-15.10 will continue to experience analyzer updates as normal until the release of GitLab 16.0, following which all newly fixed bugs and released features will be released only in the new major version of the analyzers. We do not backport bugs and features to deprecated versions as per our [maintenance policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html). As required, security patches will be backported within the latest 3 minor releases.
Specifically, the following are being deprecated and will no longer be updated after 16.0 GitLab release:

- API Fuzzing: version 2
- Container Scanning: version 5
- Coverage-guided fuzz testing: version 3
- Dependency Scanning: version 3
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): version 3
- DAST API: version 2
- IaC Scanning: version 3
- License Scanning: version 4

### Secure scanning CI/CD templates will use new job `rules`

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.9</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

GitLab-managed CI/CD templates for security scanning will be updated in the GitLab 16.0 release.
The updates will include improvements already released in the Latest versions of the CI/CD templates.
We released these changes in the Latest template versions because they have the potential to disrupt customized CI/CD pipeline configurations.

In all updated templates, we're:

- Adding support for running scans in merge request (MR) pipelines.
- Updating the definition of variables like `SAST_DISABLED` and `DEPENDENCY_SCANNING_DISABLED` to disable scanning only if the value is `"true"`. Previously, even if the value were `"false"`, scanning would be disabled.

The following templates will be updated:

- API Fuzzing: [`API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Container Scanning: [`Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Coverage-Guided Fuzzing: [`Coverage-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Coverage-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml)
- DAST: [`DAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST.gitlab-ci.yml)
- DAST API: [`DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/DAST-API.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Dependency Scanning: [`Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml)
- IaC Scanning: [`SAST-IaC.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/SAST-IaC.gitlab-ci.yml)
- SAST: [`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Secret Detection: [`Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/Secret-Detction.gitlab-ci.yml)

We recommend that you test your pipelines before the 16.0 release if you use one of the templates listed above and you do any of the following:

  1. You override `rules` for your security scanning jobs.
  1. You use the `_DISABLED` variables but set a value other than `"true"`.

Version 14.x.x [security report schemas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas) are deprecated.

In GitLab 15.8 and later, [security report scanner integrations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/integrations/secure.html) that use schema version 14.x.x will display a deprecation warning in the pipeline's **Security** tab.

In GitLab 16.0 and later, the feature will be removed. Security reports that use schema version 14.x.x will cause an error in the pipeline's **Security** tab.

<div class="deprecation-notes">

</div>

Support for using the `prometheus_exclude_database_from_default_metrics` configuration value is deprecated in GitLab
15.9 and will be removed in GitLab 16.0. We are removing this configuration value because using it is non-performant.
This change means the following metrics will become unavailable on `/metrics`:

- `gitaly_praefect_unavailable_repositories`.
- `gitaly_praefect_verification_queue_depth`.
- `gitaly_praefect_replication_queue_depth`.

This may require updating your metrics collection targets to also scrape `/db_metrics`.

### Support for periods (`.`) in Terraform state names might break existing states

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- End of Support: GitLab <span class="milestone">16.0</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Previously, Terraform state names containing periods were not supported. However, you could still use state names with periods via a workaround.

GitLab 15.7 [adds full support](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/troubleshooting.html#state-not-found-if-the-state-name-contains-a-period) for state names that contain periods. If you used a workaround to handle these state names, your jobs might fail, or it might look like you've run Terraform for the first time.

To resolve the issue:

  1. Change any references to the state file by excluding the period and any characters that follow.
     - For example, if your state name is `state.name`, change all references to `state`.
  1. Run your Terraform commands.

To use the full state name, including the period, [migrate to the full state file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/terraform_state.html#migrate-to-a-gitlab-managed-terraform-state).

### Support for third party registries

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Support for third-party container registries is deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and will be [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/376217) in GitLab 16.0. Supporting both GitLab's Container Registry and third-party container registries is challenging for maintenance, code quality, and backward compatibility. This hinders our ability to stay [efficient](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#efficiency).

Since we released the new [GitLab Container Registry](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5523) version for GitLab.com, we've started to implement additional features that are not available in third-party container registries. These new features have allowed us to achieve significant performance improvements, such as [cleanup policies](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8379). We are focusing on delivering [new features](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5136), most of which will require functionalities only available on the GitLab Container Registry. This deprecation allows us to reduce fragmentation and user frustration in the long term by focusing on delivering a more robust integrated registry experience and feature set.

Moving forward, we'll continue to invest in developing and releasing new features that will only be available in the GitLab Container Registry.

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.8</span>

</div>

Currently, GET requests to the [Cluster Agents API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/cluster_agents.html#list-tokens-for-an-agent)
endpoints can return revoked tokens. In GitLab 16.0, GET requests will not return revoked tokens.

You should review your calls to these endpoints and ensure you do not use revoked tokens.

This change affects the following REST and GraphQL API endpoints:

- REST API:
  - [List tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/cluster_agents.html#list-tokens-for-an-agent)
  - [Get a single token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/cluster_agents.html#get-a-single-agent-token)

### The latest Terraform templates will overwrite current stable templates

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

With every major GitLab version, we update the stable Terraform templates with the current latest templates.
This change affects the [quickstart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml)
and the [base](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform/Base.gitlab-ci.yml) templates.

Because the new templates ship with default rules, the update might break your Terraform pipelines.
For example, if your Terraform jobs are triggered as a downstream pipeline, the rules won't trigger your jobs
in GitLab 16.0.

To accommodate the changes, you might need to adjust the [`rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules) in your
`.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

In order to make the behavior of toggling the draft status of a merge request more clear via a quick action, we're deprecating and removing the toggle behavior of the `/draft` quick action. Beginning with the 16.0 release of GitLab, `/draft` will only set a merge request to Draft and a new `/ready` quick action will be used to remove the draft status.

### Use of `id` field in vulnerabilityFindingDismiss mutation

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.3</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

You can use the vulnerabilityFindingDismiss GraphQL mutation to set the status of a vulnerability finding to `Dismissed`. Previously, this mutation used the `id` field to identify findings uniquely. However, this did not work for dismissing findings from the pipeline security tab. Therefore, using the `id` field as an identifier has been dropped in favor of the `uuid` field. Using the 'uuid' field as an identifier allows you to dismiss the finding from the pipeline security tab.

In GitLab 15.3, [security report schemas below version 15 were deprecated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#security-report-schemas-version-14xx).
The `confidence` attribute on vulnerability findings exists only in schema versions before `15-0-0`, and therefore is effectively deprecated since GitLab 15.4 supports schema version `15-0-0`. To maintain consistency
between the reports and our public APIs, the `confidence` attribute on any vulnerability-related components of our GraphQL API is now deprecated and will be
removed in 16.0.

### Work items path with global ID at the end of the path is deprecated

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.10</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Usage of global IDs in work item URLs is deprecated. In the future, only internal IDs (IID) will be supported.

Because GitLab supports multiple work item types, a path such as `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/<global_id>` can display, for example, a [task](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/tasks.html) or an [OKR](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/okrs.html).

In GitLab 15.10 we added support for using internal IDs (IID) in that path by appending a query param at
the end (`iid_path`) in the following format: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/<iid>?iid_path=true`.

In GitLab 16.0 we will remove the ability to use a global ID in the work items path. The number at the end of the path will be considered an internal ID (IID) without the need of adding a query param at the end. Only the following format will be supported: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/<iid>`.

</div>

The certificate-based integration with Kubernetes will be [deprecated and removed](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/). As a GitLab SaaS customer, on new namespaces, you will no longer be able to integrate GitLab and your cluster using the certificate-based approach as of GitLab 15.0. The integration for current users will be enabled per namespace.

For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, we recommend you use the
[agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab. [How do I migrate?](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent.html)

Although an explicit removal date is set, we don't plan to remove this feature until the new solution has feature parity.

</div>

Previously, variables that referenced or applied alias file variables expanded the value of the `File` type variable. For example, the file contents. This behavior was incorrect because it did not comply with typical shell variable expansion rules. To leak secrets or sensitive information stored in `File` type variables, a user could run an $echo command with the variable as an input parameter.

This breaking change fixes this issue but could disrupt user workflows that work around the behavior. With this change, job variable expansions that reference or apply alias file variables, expand to the file name or path of the `File` type variable, instead of its value, such as the file contents.

### NFS for Git repository storage

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.0</span>
</div>

With the general availability of Gitaly Cluster ([introduced in GitLab 13.0](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/05/22/gitlab-13-0-released/)), we have deprecated development (bugfixes, performance improvements, etc) for NFS for Git repository storage in GitLab 14.0. We will continue to provide technical support for NFS for Git repositories throughout 14.x, but we will remove all support for NFS on November 22, 2022. This was originally planned for May 22, 2022, but in an effort to allow continued maturity of Gitaly Cluster, we have chosen to extend our deprecation of support date. Please see our official [Statement of Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#gitaly-and-nfs) for further information.

Gitaly Cluster offers tremendous benefits for our customers such as:

- [Variable replication factors](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#replication-factor).
- [Strong consistency](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#strong-consistency).
- [Distributed read capabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#distributed-reads).

We encourage customers currently using NFS for Git repositories to plan their migration by reviewing our documentation on [migrating to Gitaly Cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#migrate-to-gitaly-cluster).

### Bundled Grafana deprecated

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">15.3</span>
</div>

In GitLab 15.4, we will be swapping the bundled Grafana to a fork of Grafana maintained by GitLab.

There was an [identified CVE for Grafana](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31107), and to mitigate this security vulnerability, we must swap to our own fork because the older version of Grafana we were bundling is no longer receiving long-term support.

This is not expected to cause any incompatibilities with the previous version of Grafana. Neither when using our bundled version, nor when using an external instance of Grafana.

### SAST analyzer consolidation and CI/CD template changes

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

GitLab SAST uses various [analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers/) to scan code for vulnerabilities.

We are reducing the number of analyzers used in GitLab SAST as part of our long-term strategy to deliver a better and more consistent user experience.
Streamlining the set of analyzers will also enable faster [iteration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#iteration), better [results](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#results), and greater [efficiency](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#efficiency) (including a reduction in CI runner usage in most cases).

In GitLab 15.4, GitLab SAST will no longer use the following analyzers:

- [ESLint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/eslint) (JavaScript, TypeScript, React)
- [Gosec](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gosec) (Go)
- [Bandit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bandit) (Python)

NOTE:
This change was originally planned for GitLab 15.0 and was postponed to GitLab 15.4.
See [the removal notice](./removals.md#sast-analyzer-consolidation-and-cicd-template-changes) for further details.

These analyzers will be removed from the [GitLab-managed SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) and replaced with the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).
Effective immediately, they will receive only security updates; other routine improvements or updates are not guaranteed.
After these analyzers reach End of Support, no further updates will be provided.
We will not delete container images previously published for these analyzers; any such change would be announced as a [deprecation, removal, or breaking change announcement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations-removals-and-breaking-changes).

We will also remove Java from the scope of the [SpotBugs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs) analyzer and replace it with the [Semgrep-based analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).
This change will make it simpler to scan Java code; compilation will no longer be required.
This change will be reflected in the automatic language detection portion of the [GitLab-managed SAST CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml). Note that the SpotBugs-based analyzer will continue to cover Groovy, Kotlin, and Scala.

If you've already dismissed a vulnerability finding from one of the deprecated analyzers, the replacement attempts to respect your previous dismissal. The system behavior depends on:

- whether you’ve excluded the Semgrep-based analyzer from running in the past.
- which analyzer first discovered the vulnerabilities shown in the project’s Vulnerability Report.

See [Vulnerability translation documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers.html#vulnerability-translation) for further details.

If you applied customizations to any of the affected analyzers or if you currently disable the Semgrep analyzer in your pipelines, you must take action as detailed in the [deprecation issue for this change](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352554#breaking-change).

</div>

To reduce the overall complexity and maintenance burden of GitLab's [object storage feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html), support for using `background_upload` to upload files is deprecated and will be fully removed in GitLab 15.0. Review the [15.0 specific changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/gitlab_15_changes.html) for the [removed background uploads settings for object storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/gitlab_15_changes.html#removed-background-uploads-settings-for-object-storage).

This impacts a small subset of object storage providers:

- **OpenStack** Customers using OpenStack need to change their configuration to use the S3 API instead of Swift.
- **RackSpace** Customers using RackSpace-based object storage need to migrate data to a different provider.

GitLab will publish additional guidance to assist affected customers in migrating.

In GitLab 15.0, you can no longer change an instance (shared) runner to a project (specific) runner.

Users often accidentally change instance runners to project runners, and they're unable to change them back. GitLab does not allow you to change a project runner to a shared runner because of the security implications. A runner meant for one project could be set to run jobs for an entire instance.

Administrators who need to add runners for multiple projects can register a runner for one project, then go to the Admin view and choose additional projects.

</div>

All functionality related to GitLab's Container Network Security and Container Host Security categories is deprecated in GitLab 14.8 and scheduled for removal in GitLab 15.0. Users who need a replacement for this functionality are encouraged to evaluate the following open source projects as potential solutions that can be installed and managed outside of GitLab: [AppArmor](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor), [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium), [Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco), [FluentD](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd), [Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/). To integrate these technologies into GitLab, add the desired Helm charts into your copy of the [Cluster Management Project Template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/management_project_template.html). Deploy these Helm charts in production by calling commands through GitLab [CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/ci_cd_workflow.html).

As part of this change, the following specific capabilities within GitLab are now deprecated, and are scheduled for removal in GitLab 15.0:

- The **Security & Compliance > Threat Monitoring** page.
- The `Network Policy` security policy type, as found on the **Security & Compliance > Policies** page.
- The ability to manage integrations with the following technologies through GitLab: AppArmor, Cilium, Falco, FluentD, and Pod Security Policies.
- All APIs related to the above functionality.

### Dependency Scanning Python 3.9 and 3.6 image deprecation

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

For those using Dependency Scanning for Python projects, we are deprecating the default `gemnasium-python:2` image which uses Python 3.6 as well as the custom `gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9` image which uses Python 3.9. The new default image as of GitLab 15.0 will be for Python 3.9 as it is a [supported version](https://endoflife.date/python) and 3.6 [is no longer supported](https://endoflife.date/python).

For users using Python 3.9 or 3.9-compatible projects, you should not need to take action and dependency scanning should begin to work in GitLab 15.0. If you wish to test the new container now please run a test pipeline in your project with this container (which will be removed in 15.0). Use the Python 3.9 image:

```yaml
gemnasium-python-dependency_scanning:
  image:
    name: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9
```

For users using Python 3.6, as of GitLab 15.0 you will no longer be able to use the default template for dependency scanning. You will need to switch to use the deprecated `gemnasium-python:2` analyzer image. If you are impacted by this please comment in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351503) so we can extend the removal if needed.

For users using the 3.9 special exception image, you must instead use the default value and no longer override your container. To verify if you are using the 3.9 special exception image, check your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for the following reference:

```yaml
gemnasium-python-dependency_scanning:
  image:
    name: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python:2-python-3.9

The [external status check API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/status_checks.html) was originally implemented to
support pass-by-default requests to mark a status check as passing. Pass-by-default requests are now deprecated.
Specifically, the following are deprecated:

- Requests that do not contain the `status` field.
- Requests that have the `status` field set to `approved`.

Beginning in GitLab 15.0, status checks will only be updated to a passing state if the `status` field is both present
and set to `passed`. Requests that:

- Do not contain the `status` field will be rejected with a `422` error. For more information, see [the relevant issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338827).
- Contain any value other than `passed` will cause the status check to fail. For more information, see [the relevant issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339039).

To align with this change, API calls to list external status checks will also return the value of `passed` rather than
`approved` for status checks that have passed.

### GraphQL ID and GlobalID compatibility

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

We are removing a non-standard extension to our GraphQL processor, which we added for backwards compatibility. This extension modifies the validation of GraphQL queries, allowing the use of the `ID` type for arguments where it would normally be rejected.
Some arguments originally had the type `ID`. These were changed to specific
kinds of `ID`. This change may be a breaking change if you:

- Use GraphQL.
- Use the `ID` type for any argument in your query signatures.

Some field arguments still have the `ID` type. These are typically for
IID values, or namespace paths. An example is `Query.project(fullPath: ID!)`.

For a list of affected and unaffected field arguments,
see the [deprecation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352832).

You can test if this change affects you by validating
your queries locally, using schema data fetched from a GitLab server.
You can do this by using the GraphQL explorer tool for the relevant GitLab
instance. For example: `https://gitlab.com/-/graphql-explorer`.

For example, the following query illustrates the breaking change:

```graphql
# a query using the deprecated type of Query.issue(id:)
# WARNING: This will not work after GitLab 15.0
query($id: ID!) {
  deprecated: issue(id: $id) {
    title, description
  }
}
```

The query above will not work after GitLab 15.0 is released, because the type
of `Query.issue(id:)` is actually `IssueID!`.

Instead, you should use one of the following two forms:

```graphql
# This will continue to work
query($id: IssueID!) {
  a: issue(id: $id) {
    title, description
  }
  b: issue(id: "gid://gitlab/Issue/12345") {
    title, description
  }
}
```

This query works now, and will continue to work after GitLab 15.0.
You should convert any queries in the first form (using `ID` as a named type in the signature)
to one of the other two forms (using the correct appropriate type in the signature, or using
an inline argument expression).

The GitLab Package stage offers a Package Registry, Container Registry, and Dependency Proxy to help you manage all of your dependencies using GitLab. Each of these product categories has a variety of settings that can be adjusted using the API.

The permissions model for GraphQL is being updated. After 15.0, users with the Guest, Reporter, and Developer role can no longer update these settings:

In [GitLab 14.3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/3074), we added a configuration setting in the GitLab Runner `config.toml` file. This setting, [`[runners.ssh.disable_strict_host_key_checking]`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/ssh.html#security), controls whether or not to use strict host key checking with the SSH executor.

In GitLab 15.0 and later, the default value for this configuration option will change from `true` to `false`. This means that strict host key checking will be enforced when using the GitLab Runner SSH executor.

</div>

We deprecated legacy names for approval status of license policy (blacklisted, approved) in the `managed_licenses` API but they are still used in our API queries and responses. They will be removed in 15.0.

If you are using our License Compliance API you should stop using the `approved` and `blacklisted` query parameters, they are now `allowed` and `denied`. In 15.0 the responses will also stop using `approved` and `blacklisted` so you need to adjust any of your custom tools to use the old and new values so they do not break with the 15.0 release.

The [GitLab SAST SpotBugs analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs) scans [Java, Scala, Groovy, and Kotlin code](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) for security vulnerabilities.
For technical reasons, the analyzer must first compile the code before scanning.
Unless you use the [pre-compilation strategy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pre-compilation), the analyzer attempts to automatically compile your project's code.

In GitLab versions prior to 15.0, the analyzer image includes Java 8 and Java 11 runtimes to facilitate compilation.

In GitLab 15.0, we will:

- Remove Java 8 from the analyzer image to reduce the size of the image.
- Add Java 17 to the analyzer image to make it easier to compile with Java 17.

The GitLab SAST Security Code Scan analyzer scans .NET code for security vulnerabilities.

To make it simpler and more reliable to [customize GitLab Secret Detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/#customizing-settings), we're deprecating some of the variables that you could previously set in your CI/CD configuration.

The following variables currently allow you to customize the options for historical scanning, but interact poorly with the [GitLab-managed CI/CD template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/Secret-Detection.gitlab-ci.yml) and are now deprecated:

- `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_FROM`
- `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMIT_TO`
- `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS`
- `SECRET_DETECTION_COMMITS_FILE`

The `SECRET_DETECTION_ENTROPY_LEVEL` previously allowed you to configure rules that only considered the entropy level of strings in your codebase, and is now deprecated.
This type of entropy-only rule created an unacceptable number of incorrect results (false positives) and is no longer supported.

In GitLab 15.0, we'll update the Secret Detection [analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/terminology/#analyzer) to ignore these deprecated options.
You'll still be able to configure historical scanning of your commit history by setting the [`SECRET_DETECTION_HISTORIC_SCAN` CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/#available-cicd-variables).

<div class="deprecation-notes">

</div>

GitLab uses various [analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/terminology/#analyzer) to [scan for security vulnerabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/).
Each analyzer is distributed as a container image.

Starting in GitLab 14.8, new versions of GitLab Secure and Protect analyzers are published to a new registry location under `registry.gitlab.com/security-products`.

We will update the default value of [GitLab-managed CI/CD templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security) to reflect this change:

- For all analyzers except Container Scanning, we will update the variable `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` to the new image registry location.
- For Container Scanning, the default image address is already updated. There is no `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` variable for Container Scanning.

In a future release, we will stop publishing images to `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers`.
Once this happens, you must take action if you manually pull images and push them into a separate registry. This is commonly the case for [offline deployments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/offline_deployments/index.html).
Otherwise, you won't receive further updates.

The Secure and Protect stages will be bumping the major versions of their analyzers in tandem with the GitLab 15.0 release. This major bump will enable a clear delineation for analyzers, between:

- Those released prior to May 22, 2022, which generate reports that _are not_ subject to stringent schema validation.
- Those released after May 22, 2022, which generate reports that _are_ subject to stringent schema validation.

If you are not using the default inclusion templates, or have pinned your analyzer versions you will need to update your CI/CD job definition to either remove the pinned version or to update the latest major version.
Users of GitLab 12.0-14.10 will continue to experience analyzer updates as normal until the release of GitLab 15.0, following which all newly fixed bugs and newly released features in the new major versions of the analyzers will not be available in the deprecated versions because we do not backport bugs and new features as per our [maintenance policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html). As required security patches will be backported within the latest 3 minor releases.
Specifically, the following are being deprecated and will no longer be updated after 15.0 GitLab release:

- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Exporting Sidekiq metrics and health checks using a single process and port is deprecated.
Support will be removed in 15.0.

We have updated Sidekiq to export [metrics and health checks from two separate processes](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6409)
to improve stability and availability and prevent data loss in edge cases.
As those are two separate servers, a configuration change will be required in 15.0
to explicitly set separate ports for metrics and health-checks.
The newly introduced settings for `sidekiq['health_checks_*']`
should always be set in `gitlab.rb`.
For more information, check the documentation for [configuring Sidekiq](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/sidekiq/index.html).

These changes also require updates in either Prometheus to scrape the new endpoint or k8s health-checks to target the new
health-check port to work properly, otherwise either metrics or health-checks will disappear.

For the deprecation period those settings are optional
and GitLab will default the Sidekiq health-checks port to the same port as `sidekiq_exporter`
and only run one server (not changing the current behaviour).
Only if they are both set and a different port is provided, a separate metrics server will spin up
to serve the Sidekiq metrics, similar to the way Sidekiq will behave in 15.0.

<div class="deprecation-notes">

</div>

Long term service and support (LTSS) for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 12 SP2 [ended on March 31, 2021](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/). The CA certificates on SP2 include the expired DST root certificate, and it's not getting new CA certificate package updates. We have implemented some [workarounds](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-omnibus-builder/-/merge_requests/191), but we will not be able to continue to keep the build running properly.

### Support for gRPC-aware proxy deployed between Gitaly and rest of GitLab

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Although not recommended or documented, it was possible to deploy a gRPC-aware proxy between Gitaly and
the rest of GitLab. For example, NGINX and Envoy. The ability to deploy a gRPC-aware proxy is
[deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352517). If you currently use a gRPC-aware proxy for
Gitaly connections, you should change your proxy configuration to use TCP or TLS proxying (OSI layer 4) instead.

Gitaly Cluster became incompatible with gRPC-aware proxies in GitLab 13.12. Now all GitLab installations will be incompatible with
gRPC-aware proxies, even without Gitaly Cluster.

By sending some of our internal RPC traffic through a custom protocol (instead of gRPC) we
increase throughput and reduce Go garbage collection latency. For more information, see
the [relevant epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics/463).

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.7</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

Tracing in GitLab is an integration with Jaeger, an open-source end-to-end distributed tracing system. GitLab users can navigate to their Jaeger instance to gain insight into the performance of a deployed application, tracking each function or microservice that handles a given request. Tracing in GitLab is deprecated in GitLab 14.7, and scheduled for removal in 15.0. To track work on a possible replacement, see the issue for [Opstrace integration with GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6976).

<div class="deprecation-notes">

- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

In milestone 15.0, support for the `tags` and `tags_count` parameters will be removed from the Container Registry API that [gets registry repositories from a group](../api/container_registry.md#within-a-group).

The `GET /groups/:id/registry/repositories` endpoint will remain, but won't return any info about tags. To get the info about tags, you can use the existing `GET /registry/repositories/:id` endpoint, which will continue to support the `tags` and `tag_count` options as it does today. The latter must be called once per image repository.

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.5</span>

</div>

We are changing how the date filter works in Value Stream Analytics. Instead of filtering by the time that the issue or merge request was created, the date filter will filter by the end event time of the given stage. This will result in completely different figures after this change has rolled out.

If you monitor Value Stream Analytics metrics and rely on the date filter, to avoid losing data, you must save the data prior to this change.

### Vulnerability Check

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.8</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

The vulnerability check feature is deprecated in GitLab 14.8 and scheduled for removal in GitLab 15.0. We encourage you to migrate to the new security approvals feature instead. You can do so by navigating to **Security & Compliance > Policies** and creating a new Scan Result Policy.

The new security approvals feature is similar to vulnerability check. For example, both can require approvals for MRs that contain security vulnerabilities. However, security approvals improve the previous experience in several ways:

- Users can choose who is allowed to edit security approval rules. An independent security or compliance team can therefore manage rules in a way that prevents development project maintainers from modifying the rules.
- Multiple rules can be created and chained together to allow for filtering on different severity thresholds for each scanner type.
- A two-step approval process can be enforced for any desired changes to security approval rules.
- A single set of security policies can be applied to multiple development projects to allow for ease in maintaining a single, centralized ruleset.

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.5</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

As part of the work to create a [Package Registry GraphQL API](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6318), the Package group deprecated the `Version` type for the basic `PackageType` type and moved it to [`PackageDetailsType`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#packagedetailstype).

In milestone 15.0, we will completely remove `Version` from `PackageType`.

Currently, test coverage visualizations in GitLab only support Cobertura reports. Starting 15.0, the
`artifacts:reports:cobertura` keyword will be replaced by
[`artifacts:reports:coverage_report`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/344533). Cobertura will be the
only supported report file in 15.0, but this is the first step towards GitLab supporting other report types.

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.5</span>

</div>

We added a feature flag because [GitLab-#11582](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/11582) changed how public groups use the Dependency Proxy. Prior to this change, you could use the Dependency Proxy without authentication. The change requires authentication to use the Dependency Proxy.

In milestone 15.0, we will remove the feature flag entirely. Moving forward, you must authenticate when using the Dependency Proxy.

### `pipelines` field from the `version` field

<div class="deprecation-notes">
- Announced in: GitLab <span class="milestone">14.5</span>
- [Breaking change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/deprecation_guidelines/)
</div>

In GraphQL, there are two `pipelines` fields that you can use in a [`PackageDetailsType`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#packagedetailstype) to get the pipelines for package versions:

- The `versions` field's `pipelines` field. This returns all the pipelines associated with all the package's versions, which can pull an unbounded number of objects in memory and create performance concerns.
- The `pipelines` field of a specific `version`. This returns only the pipelines associated with that single package version.

To mitigate possible performance problems, we will remove the `versions` field's `pipelines` field in milestone 15.0. Although you will no longer be able to get all pipelines for all versions of a package, you can still get the pipelines of a single version through the remaining `pipelines` field for that version.

In GitLab 14.5, we introduced the command `gitlab-ctl promote` to promote any Geo secondary node to a primary during a failover. This command replaces `gitlab-ctl promote-db` which is used to promote database nodes in multi-node Geo secondary sites. `gitlab-ctl promote-db` will continue to function as-is and be available until GitLab 15.0.

As of 14.6 bundler-audit is being deprecated from Dependency Scanning. It will continue to be in our CI/CD template while deprecated. We are removing bundler-audit from Dependency Scanning on May 22, 2022 in 15.0. After this removal Ruby scanning functionality will not be affected as it is still being covered by Gemnasium.

If you have explicitly excluded bundler-audit using DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS you will need to clean up (remove the reference) in 15.0. If you have customized your pipeline's Dependency Scanning configuration, for example to edit the `bundler-audit-dependency_scanning` job, you will want to switch to gemnasium-dependency_scanning before removal in 15.0, to prevent your pipeline from failing. If you have not used the DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS to reference bundler-audit, or customized your template specifically for bundler-audit, you will not need to take action.

The Container Registry supports [authentication](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#auth) with `htpasswd`. It relies on an [Apache `htpasswd` file](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html), with passwords hashed using `bcrypt`.
